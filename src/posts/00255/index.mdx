This sucks. Somehow it's already time to leave Yosemite. It feels like there's so much we haven't done. In fact, we made a list - of all the walks we could have done if we had one more day here. But no, we have 5.5 hours to drive today and Yosemite is in the opposite direction that we need to drive.

So we picked a walk that was only several hours long.

And only two hours drive from our AirBnB. It's a nice place to have stayed but staying inside Yosemite would have saved so much time. But we can't complain since this trip was booked last minute, and the weather has been nice for two of the three days.

Much to Betty's chagrin she was hustled out the door before 8am.

We drove to the Tioga Road - which is a road that goes over the Tioga pass. This was the road that we needed to drive in 2019 to cross from California to Nevada. The road usually opens in late May for summer traffic. But in 2019 they had a hard winter and the road didn't open until mid June - two days before we needed to use it.

(Side story - we had some friends travelling in this area earlier this year and they were also planning to travel the Tioga Road. I told them our story but mentioned that they should be fine since they were visiting Yosemite in July. Well, nope - extra, extra helping of snow this year and the road stayed closed well into July.)

The walk we were planning was to Watkin Mountain. This trail wasn't on any of the official guides. It wasn't even on Google Maps. To find the start I had to put in a custom destination in Google Maps. There wasn't even any signage at the start of the trail. Well, except for this one directing us back to Yosemite Valley.

Another couple had arrived a few minutes before us. They looked a bit lost so I checked and they were going to Watkin Mountain too. Then just as we were starting the walk another vehicle pulled up and asked if this was the Watkin Mountain trail. I only mention this because I think these two groups of people might have been the only people we saw on this trail.

Yeah, this wasn't a popular walk. One issue I was worried about was that we needed to turn off this Yosemite trail. But if there's no signs here, chances are there would be no signs at the turnoff. I had put down another custom destination where I thought the turnoff might be - and it's a good thing I did. The only reason we found the turnoff was because we knew to look for it.

As you can see from the photos the forest was rather sparse. I guess this is what you get at 2,600 metres above sea level. Yosemite has such a wide variety of forests. There's the dry, hot forest outside the park where we are staying. There's the lush forest in the canyon. Then there's this tundra.

// Decided to do a walk called Watkin Mountain. It was on the Tioga Road, which we hadn't seen before but it was almost an extra hour of drive for us

// The trailhead wasn't marked, but I had planned ahead and put down a marker on Google Maps. Arrived at the same time as a couple of other couples, but none of them seemed super confident about where the trail started.

// The trail went along a longer path, but then split off. Fortunately I had placed another marker on where the junction was, otherwise we totally would have missed it.

// A nice view

// Afterwards drove to Santa Rosa. Fell dark at 7pm while we were still driving, but that was a good thing because we were driving west and the sun had been a real issue. We did see two car accidents along the way though.
