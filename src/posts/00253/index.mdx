// Had to wake up early for a 9am interview. It could have been worse - it could have been an 8am interview like I planned, but it seems daylight savings happened in Canada

// Late getting going and it was almost two hours to our planned hike, despite having accommodation near the park

// Cold as soon as we got out of the car. I wore my sweater for the whole hike, which is a rarity

// A bit of cloud around at Taft Point

// Managed to get a glimpse of Half Dome

// Decided to climb Sentinel Dome despite the top being amongst the clouds. At the top we got the view we expected - mostly white in most of the directions

// Drove on to Glacier Point

// Arrived back at sunset
