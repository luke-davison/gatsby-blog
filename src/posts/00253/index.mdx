Yosemite National Park was our first experience in a US national park back in 2019. Back then we were only able to spend 24 hours in the park but it left a lasting impression on us. To occupy time on this trip while driving long distances, sometimes we like to rank the parks we’ve been to. I always want to put Yosemite near the top. But does it deserve such a spot? Or do we only remember it favourably because at that point in time we hadn’t seen any others?

Unfortunately back on our original road trip around the US we couldn’t justify driving to California to revisit Yosemite. That made me sad. So I am very happy that this return journey gives us the opportunity to revisit what might be the best national park in the whole continent. We have up to four days (three nights) to explore all the areas of the park we didn’t get to last time.

Except we got off to a slow start.

As I’ve mentioned already, the weather was a bit sketchy yesterday so we didn’t rush to the park, preferring to spend time with a bunch of cats. Then we got off to a late start this morning too because I actually had an interview.

// Had to wake up early for a 9am interview. It could have been worse - it could have been an 8am interview like I planned, but it seems daylight savings happened in Canada

// Late getting going and it was almost two hours to our planned hike, despite having accommodation near the park

// Cold as soon as we got out of the car. I wore my sweater for the whole hike, which is a rarity

// A bit of cloud around at Taft Point

// Managed to get a glimpse of Half Dome

// Decided to climb Sentinel Dome despite the top being amongst the clouds. At the top we got the view we expected - mostly white in most of the directions

// Drove on to Glacier Point

// Arrived back at sunset
