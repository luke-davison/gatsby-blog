So by default, you’re going to put some ugly watermarks on my photos without telling me? I get a nice new phone to take nice pictures and you ruin them telling everyone that I bought a cheap one? You may be pretty and smudge free (for now) but you’re not off to a good start.

Anyway, I’ve found the setting to turn it off – but looks like we’re stuck with them for the ones I have already taken.
