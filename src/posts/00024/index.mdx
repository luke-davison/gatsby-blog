Since we all went to bed early, we all woke up before 7. And this is what we woke to:

You might be thinking, “But Luke, these photos are of the same places as the ones in the previous blog post.” And you’d be right. But if you look very closely, you’ll notice one small change.

Yep, I cleaned the lens on my camera. Oh, and also the sun was out.

Up early, we decided to tackle the most popular walk in the park – the Hooker valley trail. It is a three hour return, flat (ish) walk down the valley toward Mount Cook. It was certainly not a short walk but we all set off to do it.

> We can actually see the mountain now

Being so early, the sun had not fully climbed to its peak. And so to start we had to walk in the shade.

> It was cold in the darkness

But it didn’t take long for the sun to find us again.

> Betty enjoying the sun

Lots of pretty pictures to post. I did mention this was the most popular walk, didn’t I?

> Here’s Betty again, leaving me behind

There were very few people on the way there.

Of course it had been raining recently so there was a lot of water about. However the paths were generally quite excellent, allowing us to mostly avoid any puddles. That is, until I remembered that I can be creative.

> This is basically a tarn, right?

Though soon after we came across an actual tarn.

> Yeah, this is a lot better than that puddle from earlier

![Image](img_20201118_092103.jpg)

> Here I am, looking pleased despite the fact I am blocking the reflection.

I mentioned it wasn’t a short walk, right?

![Image](img_20201118_092626.jpg)

> Still not there

At the end of the walk was a large grey lake. Interestingly, there were a couple of icebergs today.

> Still got to walk back 😦

But even as we arrived we noticed the clouds were building.

> Luke likes clouds

On the way there the sky had been basically cloud free. Now the clouds frequently obscured the mountains.

> Where’d it go?

We basically timed our walk perfectly. We started just as the shadows were leaving and finished just as the clouds moved in.

![Image](img_20201118_100430.jpg)

> Can still see a lot though

The path was a lot busier on the way back. I guess it was late enough that a lot of people had time to drive in from Twizel or Tekapo. Or maybe they just weren’t as early to start as us.

![Image](img_20201118_101647.jpg)

> Okay, getting a bit harder to find Mount Cook now

It probably wasn’t as busy as when we were here five years ago but it certainly wasn’t quiet.

![Image](img_20201118_103511.jpg)

> Yet I was still able to get so many pictures of empty paths

I really wanted to revisit one of the walks from last night. But I felt bad asking Betty’s Mum and Aunt to wait in the car while we walked it. So on we went.

> Back the way we came\!
Though we did stop briefly at Lake Pukaki so we could capture what it actually looks likes in nice weather.

![Image](img_20201118_113619.jpg)

> Very blue

And that was it for Mount Cook.

![Image](img_20201118_113645.jpg)

> Goodbye

Next stop – Wanaka.
