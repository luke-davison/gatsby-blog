Prior to coming on this trip, several people asked us where we were going. They would often react with surprise when we mentioned that we were visiting Florida. Some people jumped to the conclusion that we were visiting Orlando to visit Disneyland. Good guess, but not the case.

If you have ever met us, you’ll know that we play a lot of boardgames. It’s a growing hobby and the biggest markets at the moment are North America and Europe. These markets have a number of large conventions where thousands of people meet up for various boardgame activities. For these reasons, we’ve been a bit envious of citizens of these continents.

When we decided to travel to North America, we figured that we might as well time our trip to align with one of the big conventions. We also wanted to escape the New Zealand winter which limited which ones we could attend. Fortunately two of the biggest ones were in July and August.

Gen Con is perhaps the largest gaming convention (not just limited to boardgaming). It is perhaps the biggest event in North America for publishers to release and sell their games. The other option was Dice Tower Con which was run in conjunction with a popular Youtube channel that reviews games. Their Con was more focused around playing games. Neither Con was near anywhere we were going to be visiting anyway, which was a shame.

We ended up choosing to attend Dice Tower Con. Gen Con might have been more impressive but as we are travelling, we can’t be buying many games. Plus, it was later in summer and our trip would have coincided more with the US school holidays and worse weather.

We arrived late in the afternoon on the Fourth of July. The Con had already been going a whole day and a half by that point. Having nothing else to do, we decided we may as well join in on the gaming.

The convention centre that the Con was being held in was huge. It had a hall filled with tables and chairs for gaming, a hall filled with distributors, and a hall filled with chairs for presentations. It also had a small room reserved for games that anyone could “check out” (like a library) and play.

> Here’s the hall with the tables. I actually don’t think this picture does the size of the hall justice. It was huge.

We looked over the shelves and picked out a co-operative game called Rising 5. It came out a few years ago and while we had been interested, we didn’t know anyone who had a copy so we’d never played it.

One problem with trying new games at places like these is that we need time to learn them. After looking back at all the games played, its clear that much time was wasted. But we didn’t have much other alternatives as finding someone who knows how to play and can teach us was like finding a needle in a haystack.

It also meant that we were frequently playing just the two of us, as it is much more manageable learning a game between two than higher numbers.

Anyway, we played Rising 5 twice (the second time was because we beat the standard difficulty relatively easily and we wanted a better challenge). Then we checked out a different game and lost horribly. By this time we were hungry so we bought a pizza.

When we were back in our room, we then realised that we had no idea what time it was. The flight had messed up our sense of time plus I always lose my sense of time when playing games.

Timezones was also an issue. See, phones have this great feature nowadays where they automatically change the time when timezones or daylight savings changes. But the downside is that we rely on them too much. If we had been forced to set the time every time we changed timezones then we would have been more aware.

Anyway, we had been planning to attend a panel event at 9pm. While eating our pizza, we sat trying to figure out what the time was. The clocks in the room weren’t consistent. Our phones weren’t consistent (because some had switched to the new timezone and some hadn’t). I couldn’t figure out whether we were supposed to be gaining two hours or losing two hours from the change in timezone.

Naturally, the time turned out to be 9:15 once we figured it out and we had missed the panel event. However, it did explain why it was so dark, and why we were so hungry. In hindsight, it probably should have been obvious.

So we settled in for the night. (Well, Betty did. Luke snuck out to play one more game).

The next few days were similar. We’d get up, check out some of the stalls selling games, and then play a whole bunch.

There were a few games that we wanted to try. Some we got to play. There was one game in particular – “The Quacks of Quedlinbgrg” (weird title, I know) – that we wanted to check out. There were three copies in the library. The problem was that it was a very “hot” game and everyone else wanted to try it to. The only time we ever saw that game available was when it was too late at night to learn and play a new game.

So we learnt and whole bunch of games, bought a few small games, attended a panel event (where we watched a podcast being recorded) and that was it for the Con.

That doesn’t sound like we ended up doing much and looking back on it, I’d almost agree. But at the time I remember it feeling like we were somehow always short on time. There was a huge gap between posts to this blog around that time because I didn’t have the time or energy to write anything. All we were doing was playing games but that takes up a surprising amount of time and concentration.

Overall we enjoyed it. I don’t know if it was good value for money for our trip but it was definitely worth doing once. After two weeks of travelling around National Parks, this felt like a nice break. It’s a pity we were too busy with the convention to use to use the resort facilities at the hotel. Otherwise it might have been a more relaxing break.
