Man - this trip has been a long time coming.

Some backstory: the idea of us travelling to Canada for a working holiday dates back to 2020.  We then learned that while we were to old for most "youth" visas,  we were not too old for working holidays in three countries - Finland, Slovakia, and Canada.  So basically there was no decision.  We had loved our time in Canada in 2019, it is primarily English speaking (not required but it helps), it's huge with lots of places to see, and the people there are known to be generally pretty nice.

But of course 2020 was not the year for travelling.  Borders were locked down.  No country was processing visas.  And you might have heard that there was a killer virus going round.  Two years later the world had returned to some sense of normality and Luke and Betty were pondering their options.  Betty was desperate for a change of job.  Luke had finally decided that he did want the experience of living in another country.  So, in early March 2022 we started to take action.

First step was to enter a To do this we needed to enter a lottery.  This could have ended our plans before they had begun.  Worst case scenario would have been if only one of our names was drawn out.  However we needn't had bothered worrying.  Both our names were drawn out within the week.

Next was the decision about when to accept the invitation to apply.  Once the application process was over we would have a twelve months to arrive in Canada.  We didn't want to arrive straight away.  We would need time to plan and wrap things up in New Zealand.  We also didn't want to arrive in winter as this would greatly reduce the amount of sightseeing we could do - plus we'd be missing out on a New Zealand summer.  So ideally we wanted to arrive in June 2023 - but this was 15 months away.  So we delayed as much as we could but ultimately the process determined we had to enter by early May 2023.

So now we had a date - start of May 2023.  It was time to start planning.  We knew we wanted to travel before finding jobs so first port of call was to research where we might want to go.  Canada is huge - but it actually doesn't feel as large as it looks.  Most of the good stuff is relatively near the southern border with the USA.  So holiday plan A was to cross the continent following the border.

Then we found an issue with that plan.  Since Betty was technically a healthcare worker she had to go through a physical exam as part of the application process - and this would expire in May 2023 so we had to enter Canada before then.  But despite summer being right around the corner, most of the interesting parks would still be frozen for another one to two months.

So we adapted.  Rather than change our plans we would just add some extra travel onto the start.  And fortunately we had a great idea.  Being more southerly, summer arrives much earlier in the USA than it does in Canada.  So we decided that we'd get our visas and then hop the border for a few weeks.

Then in late 2022 the world decided it was going to change again.  Inflation worldwide went to levels not seen since the 80s or 90s and for whatever reason the New Zealand dollar's value also plummeted.  This might mean our pre-work holiday might be too ambitious.  So rather than crossing the continent we decided that after our USA excursion we'd just head up to the parks in the Canadian Rockies.

While this was all going on we were also having to start letting people know.  It wasn't the easiest thing to do to start telling our friends and families that they wouldn't be seeing us for a long time.  Nor would it be easy to tell our colleagues that they would have to be continuing on without us.  These announcements were dribbled out over months when we felt like the timing was right.

Then in November 2022 it was time to start booking.  Flights were booked.  Insurance was purchased.  And we had to start organising accommodation.  It turned out that a lot of summer accommodation in and around the national parks would book out very quickly and we had to get in as soon as they became available - which was usually 4am New Zealand time.  So Luke had to wake up in the middle of the night about ten times over the course of five months.

But what to do with all our stuff while we were away?  Everything needed to be either sold, dumped, or put into storage.  And over the last six years we'd accrued a lot of stuff.  Plus Betty's house would need to be rented out, which meant repairs and improvements would need to be made.  It turned out that thousands of dollars was needing to be spent.

To quit our jobs we also had to go through the process of going through leaving ceremonial dinners and lunches.  Without exception our colleagues were all very encouraging and excited for us, lamenting the void we'd both leave behind at our respective workplaces - which was really nice.  Certainly made us have moments of guilt at leaving these lovely people behind.

Then once we had quit, we had to pack and clean.  We had allocated a whole week for this.  And it was not an easy week.  We had quit our jobs but now we found ourselves working harder (and specifically more physically) then we ever had before.

When it was all done we were a bit broken.

This was certainly an exciting time in our lives but there had been so much setup to get here.  Sacrifices had been made over the 14 or so months this had been in the works.  Time, effort, sweat, and tears had been spent and as we packed the last load of stuff into our car and what did we have to show for it?  An clean and empty house that was about to be someone else's.

And the work isn't over.  Once we arrive in Canada there will be a bunch of further tasks to do such as opening bank accounts, buying a car, getting drivers licences, applying for jobs, and finding a permanent place to live.

When are we going to be able to start having fun?

As we left Hamilton for the last time we had no answer to this question.

But we found something when we arrived in Auckland.  Unbeknownst to us, instead of storing our furniture away in her spare room as planned she had arranged our furniture in the downstairs area in resemblance of what it had looked like in Hamilton.  It was a strangely welcome gesture.  It reminded us that we hadn't just spent the last 14 months erasing our lives in New Zealand.  It was all still here, and would be here for us to return to when we got back.

With two days to go before we leave, I think I can see again excitement and fun in our future.  We  had people tell us that an overseas experience is something you never forget and never regret.  And those voices we all unanimous.
