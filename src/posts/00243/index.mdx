Grand Canyon North Rim was the third place we had intended to visit in May but couldn't due to the stubbornly persistent snow (that we never actually saw). We have one last full day in Utah so one more day in Grand Canyon? Hell yeah.

A pity about the weather though. Yesterday in Zion there had been clear blue skies all today. Just like the day before in Cedar Breaks. Well today it would rain. When would it rain? Not sure - the forecasts were a bit inconsistent. Sometime in the morning perhaps? We were intending to arrive around noon - hopefully when the weather would have passed. Well not long after we left our accommodation we hit the rain, which just got wetter and wetter as we drove.

This is usually where I post a picture of the entrance sign. "Too wet, we'll stop on the way back," we told ourselves. We also basically drove straight past the entrance booth. Today is actually National Public Lands Day, which means all the parks are free to enter. At least North Rim is really far from any major cities so hopefully it won't be swarmed with people trying to take advantage of the free entry.

We arrived at the carpark by the visitor centre and it was still raining. Okay, what now? The answer was obvious - we should use the restrooms. After all, the drive had not been a short one. During the five minutes it took for us to do our business the weather did seem to start clearing up. We had set out to hopefully arrive right after the rain finished. Perhaps we timed it almost exactly right.

We grabbed our rain jackets anyway and set off to walk to the most popular viewpoint in the park. Near the carpark was a shelter where a park ranger offered to take our picture overlooking the canyon. Here's what we could see:

> On the bright side, it's not entirely covered in cloud

I guess even if we managed to arrive just as the rain finished, that doesn't mean the clouds magically disappear. Usually cloudy days are only problematic in the mountains. I guess canyon terrain is not that dissimilar to mountain ranges. Remember how I said there was still snow here in May? It's clearly very elevated and not surprising that we're standing amongst the clouds.

We walked on anyway and lo and behold, we could actually see stuff!

This was exciting. We came round a corner and there was a mostly cloud-free section of the canyon in front of us. "Quick," I said. "Take my photo before it disappears." We had heard tales of people who visit the Grand Canyon and barely see anything.

> Hooray - we can see!

I needn't have been so hasty. The clouds seemed to be clearing. However, I do get excited when I see tiny clouds lower than the mountains. I think it makes it look extra scenic.

As we continued walking towards the point we noticed that we were walking along a ridge. To our right was the mostly unclouded view, but to our left was still the solid mass of white.

When we reached the point we found the view to be quite clear. In fact I would go so far as to say it was amazingly clear.

Even the clouds to the east in the previous pictures started dissipating. I said earlier that we left at a certain time hoping to arrive just after the bad weather. It seems like we were perfectly on time.

All that's left to do is the usual walk along the canyon rim, stopping at every viewpoint to admire... everything.

![Image](PXL_20230923_180425589.jpg)

Annoyingly the trail we were following didn't stick to the rim for very long. We were then walking through forests. On the bright side this means we can loop back to the carpark without having to double-back on ourselves.

Back at the carpark our good luck with the weather seemed to run out. It started raining steadily again. We ran to the gift shop to take a look around and see if we could wait it out. The ranger seemed to think it might rain for much of the afternoon. After Betty convinced me that we didn't need to buy a Utah jigsaw puzzle, we had to make a long dash back to our car.

There was surprisingly little to see near the visitor's centre. Perhaps the rim isn't suitable for a nice long walk along it. However this is not all there is to see in this part of the park. There is also a 45 minute scenic drive. We figured, "why not?" It's not like we have anything else planned for today.

We decided just to drive to Point Imperial. This would only take 10 minutes and would hopefully give us an idea if the weather might change again. Well the rain did lessen down to almost nothing, but we still had an issue with clouds.

Point Imperial is the highest point in the park so of course it's going to be covered in clouds. I left Betty in the dry comfort of the car and darted out to the viewpoint. I was going to include a photo here of what I saw but there's no need. Just imagine an almost completely white square - that's what the photo looked like.

Despite saying we'd turn around if the weather improved, it didn't feel like we'd given the scenic drive a chance. Again telling ourselves that we have nothing better to do, we committed to the full drive.

We arrived at the carpark at the end in much the same conditions as Point Imperial. We had glimpsed parts of the canyon along the way, but it had mostly been white. Like Point Imperial, I had the job of scouting ahead to see if the walk was worthwhile.

The walk ended up being longer than I had expected. The white annoyingness was still everywhere but it did seem like we might be able to see some things. I decided to turn around and go get Betty - mostly because I didn't want to have to do the whole walk twice.

Well at the end of the walk there was this:

Again the clouds around us just... vanished, revealing a panorama view of the canyon.

We've seen a lot of canyons on this trip, but there really isn't anything else quite like the Grand Canyon.

![Image](PXL_20230923_204453983.jpg)

Even on a mostly cloudy day it was quite the sight.

Insert another paragraph or sentence here with further justification for including so many pretty pictures.

We were hoping we might walk some of the trail into the canyon, like we had done at South Rim, but we don't have our hikers legs anymore. Also it was cold and the clouds clearly could not be trusted to stay away.

After enjoying our time at Cape Royal Point, we wandered back and took another path to a vista called Angels Window. Unfortunately the vista was on top of the window so all we had to look at was a panoramic view of the whole canyon.

> This blog I built isn't really suited for panorama photos, but here's one anyway

Here's another photo of happy Luke and Betty.

We walked back to a place where we could see the window.

> "There it is"

This was where I walked to earlier, before returning to go get Betty. I stood where Betty is standing in the above photo and stared intently out into the canyon. This was only 20 minutes ago and it had been completely cloud covered at the time.

With the weather now fine, we drove back along the road stopping at other viewpoints. The first good. But the second...

![Image](PXL_20230923_213338865.jpg)

> Where's the canyon gone? And why are there puddles?

It seemed that the rain had returned. Or rather, we'd returned to the rain. Another touristing couple pulled up and asked if it was worth driving all the way to Cape Royal. I don't know if they believed me when I told them the cloud just magically disappeared in a few hundred metres further.

So we grabbed a picture with the sign on the way out.

![Image](PXL_20230923_221018142.jpg)

As you can see I did not pose for long. The weather stayed rainy for the next hour and a half of driving before returning to the magical Utah blue skies as we approached the Zion area.

Goodbye Grand Canyon. It's been so nice to be able to see you one last time. But don't worry - if we're ever in the American South-west again I'm sure we'll drop by.
