Our flight to Orlando was basically on time. We were a bit late taking off but we had no troubles on arrival. After having a late lunch in the food court, we called our first Uber ever. It was a reasonably pleasant experience. We may never use a traditional taxi service again.

As soon as we left the terminal to catch our ride, two things hit us. Firstly, where was my backpack? While the Uber guy waited I had to run through part of the airport back to the food court. Fortunately my bag was still where I left it. While running I remembered, that backpack was almost exclusively filled with snacks. It literally was the only bag we could afford to lose. Fortunately, we didn’t and the snacks were later eaten and were delicious.

The second thing was the weather. We already knew Florida was extremely humid. We had mentally prepared for that. What we had not prepared for was thunderstorms.

Up until now, we had only had one morning of rain (in Yellowstone). Otherwise, the weather had always been sunny, or occasionally overcast. For the first ten minutes of our ride to our hotel, the weather was full-on thunderstorms.

We woke up the next morning to sunny weather. This was more like the Orlando we were expecting. Then later that day, the thunderstorms returned.

This happened every single day. The weather in the morning would be sunny. From early afternoon to some time before dusk there would be on/off thunderstorms. After dark would be relatively fine.

I guess it’s good that the weather was consistent. It certainly made us think twice about going to a theme park knowing that the weather would turn on us part way through the day. Staying indoors, playing board games was certainly the preferred activity at all times.

Even when the sun was out, the weather was rather unpleasant. It was a manageable hot but the humidity (not unexpectedly) made it unpleasant to be outside. This was kind of annoying because the air conditioning in all parts of the hotel was freezing. Inside was too cold but the outdoors was too hot.

We had a moment of panic when we entered our hotel room and it too was freezing. We could not find the thermostat to adjust the air conditioning. Was the temperature set globally for the entire hotel? Fortunately we eventually found it behind a door and set it to a more manageable level.

Walking from our hotel room to the convention centre was interesting. We’d exit our hotel room. The rest of the building was cold but not too bad. We’d have to leave the building and enter the hot Florida summer air. Then we’d enter another building (going from hot back to very cold) then back out again (cold to hot again) before finally entering the convention centre (hot to cold).

I forget, are rapid changes in temperature bad for the body?

> We were “lucky” enough to stay in this room. 1408 is a story by Stephen King about an evil hotel room. Could this be the source of the thunderstorms?
