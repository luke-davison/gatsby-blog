On the map for the Catlins area (south of Dunedin, east of Invercargill) there is a bit green splodge called “Catlin Forest Park”. I figured there’d be a bunch of things to do there so I booked the accommodation to be nearby.

Turns out there’s not a great deal of walks there. Sure, there are some but they’re not notable walks. The trails either link a couple of roads or they lead out to a hut which isn’t anywhere notable. So after failing to find anything notable to do today, I just picked a whole bunch of small things to visit before we head to Dunedin.

So let’s start by rating some waterfalls.

First is McLean falls.

Overall pretty good. Still a lot of water despite being so late into summer. Good height on the rear falls and some interesting rock things going on at the front. I give it 7.5/10

Next was Matai Falls.

A lot less going on here. Some good height but not a whole deal of water. Just an ordinary waterfall. 5/10.

A few minutes uphill on the same trail was Horseshoe falls.

Annoyingly it was difficult to see to due to the plants. Still not a good deal of water and no sign of why it is called “horseshoe” falls. 3.5/10.

And last (after a lunch stop) was Purakaunui falls.

Somehow even less water. Probably better in winter / early spring. It still has a bit more going on than the last one so… 4/10.

And that’s the end of Luke’s waterfall reviews. Verdict – definitely stop by McLean falls. Matai falls is pretty decent (plus you get Horseshoe falls thrown in for almost free). Probably skip Purakaunui falls – it’s the furthermost from the main road too.

Next stop was to see Jack’s Blowhole. It involved a section of gravel road driving only to arrive unexpectedly at an east coast bach town called Jack’s Bay. Wasn’t expecting to find baches out here. Would be really nice to have one but it’s a bit far from Hamilton.

There was a 20 minute walk to the blowhole. Scenery was nice.

The actual blowhole was a bit disappointing. We found the hole (interestingly located 200 metres inland) but where’s the blow? Probably somewhere else due to it being low tide and not in the middle of a cyclone.

Next stop was not a planned stop. We were heading to Nugget Point along the coast and this old lady was wandering down the side of the road. As we neared she approached our moving car. Not sure what she wanted – unlikely that she was a beggar since she clearly had her own car. Did she need help? I guess we can’t deny a senior citizen our assistance.

Turns out that she’d spied a sea lion on the beach and she wanted to tell us.

It seemed quite a big one. It just kind of sat there doing sea lion things before deciding it’s time for bed. And when I say “bed” I don’t just mean it went to sleep. It literally wandered over to a big ball of seaweed and laid its head on it like a pillow. Then it covered itself in a blanket of sand.

We made it to Nugget point and while it was quite sunny, there was something which wasn’t perfect. Let’s see if you can tell from the following picture what it was:

> It’s a subtle thing

Despite that I think we can call Betty’s streak of visiting lighthouses only during bad weather has been broken.

> Look at all that blue in the sky

There’s not much that beats sunny coastal weather.

While we were at Nugget Point there was another bay where yellow eyed penguins came to nest. The signs said they returned from the sea from 4pm. It happened to be 3:45pm so we figured we’d stick round for a while.

But every possible penguin sightings we saw turned out just to be weed. Probably on such a fine day the penguins were probably having a good hunt at sea and wouldn’t turn up until later. After 45 minutes or so we left, having seen as many penguins as we did every other day of our holiday.

And that was our trip to the Catlin area. Now on to Dunedin.
