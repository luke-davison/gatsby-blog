// It's expensive but decided to go to Universal Studios. Betty had a good time there as a teen and Luke likes movies. Annoying that parking was $50 NZD in addition to the ticket prices but it would likely be better than trying to find a shuttle or public transportation. Also annoying that a child is only 11 and under - and their ticket price is mere dollars cheaper. Poor parents.

// Arrived early. Park doesn't open until 10am on Wednesdays. Lots of people clearly already there

// Was able to go inside and join a big group. Then this group was let free.

// Intended to go for the Studio tour first, but took a wrong turn. Going through Harry Potter world turned out not to be a shortcut. Ended up walking into a ride we didn't know but just went with it.

// It turned out to be a kind of motion simulator. We were essentially put four people to a couch which was on a mechanical arm. This arm then flung us around simulating a flying broom journey. Interestingly at some points we'd pass by screens which would cover our entire field of view and would project a scene like flying through the castle grounds. We must have still been moving (otherwise the next chair would have caught up). Overall it was a really impressive ride.

// However Luke was reminded that he gets motion sick. He was glad that cold air was sprayed onto his forehead for the entire ride, and he had to close his eyes for some parts

// Afterwards we collected our belongings from our lockers (secured by fingerprint which was a nice and modern system). Right outside was a rollercoaster with seemingly very little line (not sure if the park was technically even open yet) so we decided to do that.

// We were at the very end so the acceleration was a bit weird. Fortunately for Luke's stomach it was a quick coaster

// On the way out we stopped for Betty to use the restroom. Right nearby was Ollivander's shop, which was a "ride" of sorts. More of a magic show. We were taken into the shop and the proprietor selected a couple of kids and gave them wands. She then told them to point them at various things and effects happened. That was it. It was fine, and it didn't take long. We were of course funnelled through the gift shop where we could buy our own wand if we wanted. I wonder if the kids got theirs for free or if the parents would feel pressured to buy them. Seems like the latter.

// With us now having a queasy Luke we decided we'd go do the studio tour, which is an hour-long tour by cart through the Universal lot. Unfortunately it was a bit bumpy, so it wasn't the relaxing rest Luke needed. Then it headed into a tunnel where a 3D King Kong film played. For this the cart had been attached to a motion simulator. This was quite bad for Luke's stomach. We weren't moving, but the cart was shaking and the eyes said we were moving. It was really impressive but boy was it queasy.

// There was a bit of a breeze when we came out. The driver told us to take our 3D glasses off, but to save them because we'll need them later. Crap.

// The tour itself went past various soundstages while the announcer listed the shows and movies that were filming or had been filmed there. There wasn't much to see because they were basically just big square buildings with numbers on them. We did get to see some props and sets, but they were often a bit generic (so that they could be reused) or they hadn't kept well (since they were outside).

// While trying to take some sips of water to cool himself down (the Hollywood heat wasn't helping his queasiness), Luke dropped Betty's phone which bounced out of the cart. We had to pull the emergency stop cord and ask for the announcer to retrieve it. This was allowed but it did feel bad. I just hoped that I wouldn't have to apologise to him again for puking.

// The other use for the 3D glasses was similar to the first - a dark tunnel where the cart is put on a motion simulator while a movie played all around - this time for Fast and Furious. Luke didn't watch any of it. Fortunately this tactic worked and he felt no worse than when they went in.

// After the studio tour Luke wasn't great. It was basically time to find somewhere to sit. But first, he found some fans with cooling mist. I don't know if this is specifically for motion sickness - probably more for people overheating in the hot summer sun. But regardless, Luke stuck his head in it for about a minute to recover

// Decided to watch the Waterworld show next. Walked around for a bit waiting for the start time. Mario World is the newest part of the park and it certainly is impressive. Lots of cartoony, moving things that do make it look like you're in a video game.

// Waterworld was a stunt show based on the 90s Waterworld movie. The movie itself was a flop, but I guess the setting is unique enough that it has been kept as a show. And it was a good show. There were green seats that were designated splash zones. When the jet skis came round they would often send sprays of water onto these seats. However at the start there were also some hype guys who would chuck half full buckets of water into these areas when their section wasn't cheering loud enough.

// Luke had recovered pretty well after sitting down for the better part of half an hour. However despite being past lunch time he wasn't going to be eating anything today. Perhaps he should have had less of a breakfast.

// Next was the Jurassic World ride, which was a water ride. So not a whole lot of jostling around, but still some when the boat went on tracks. There were also some amazing special effects. Right before the boat dropped down the big final drop there were a couple of dinosaurs which neither of us could tell whether they were animatronic or we were looking at a screen. They just looked real.

// This was also another situation where guests were guaranteed that you would get wet. The drop at the end was fine but throughout dinosaurs and other things were finding any excuse to splash or spray water onto the boat. Luke didn't mind this of course - nice and cooling. Perhaps that's why so many people here are okay with it - Los Angeles is hot.

// We got some Butterbeer and explored the Harry Potter world area. The Butterbeer was delicious and nice and cooling. It was a full $16 NZD but it was worth it. While drinking it we also spotted people waving wands around. Turns out there are markers in the ground where if you wave certain wands (some are just replicas) in certain ways at those certain places then an action will happen. There seemed to be quite a lot of these places about. That's a nice touch - adding some interactivity to the scenery. Still, buying a wand likely wasn't cheap.

// By this point the park had filled up. Wait times for rides were posted in various places, and on the companion app that had the park map. Wait times would usually vary between 15 and 75 minutes. Fortunately we'd been lucky so far with our queues.

// Next ride was the Mummy. It was an indoor coaster. It went really fast almost from the start and smooth enough. But when we stopped it was another matter. Poor Luke. Still, he laughed at himself a lot. A grown man getting motion sick all the time. Seems he can't be a kid any more.

// We also went on the Despicable Me ride - which was another motion simulator in front of a curved screen. Luke didn't even try to watch it. The five (estimate) year old girl next to him seemed to be having a great time.

// Checked the list of other rides. They all were motion simulators of sorts.

// Saw a harry potter themed "show" of sorts. It was basically four ladies doing ballet stuff while three men did fight stunts. Then men definitely had the better part. One day they ought to gender flip the parts so the ladies can get a chance to do the cool acrobatics and the men can do the girly dancing.

// Visited some gift shops

// Watched the Waterworld show again. There were some slight differences. This time the ski jumper didn't fall. Also it turns out the villain was supposed to hit the golf ball into the audience (he failed terribly the time earlier). It is always interesting how the jokes change based on what happens.

// Walked around some more. More perusing gift shops.

// There seems to be late night events at the park during Halloween season. There were masses of people waiting for this when we left.

// Panda Express on the way home. Luke did get a bit dizzy again driving down the spiral ramp out of the car park.

// A good day. A shame the studio tour wasn't better. Luke's stomach would definitely have enjoyed more behind-the-scenes and movie trivia but I guess they wanted to make it more of an experience. I imagine they're cheaper and simpler to make, and probably less dangerous than conventional rides - which is why there is so many of them.
