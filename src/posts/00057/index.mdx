Well, we’re in Vancouver now. The last stop on our journey back to New Zealand.

Like New York, accommodation in Vancouver was a bit more expensive than what we perceived its value to be so we booked a place through Airbnb in North Vancouver. This meant we’d be close to the hiking trails etc. It did mean we were quite far away (and across the water) from the city centre.

After being told it’s not worth trying to park in the city centre, we hopped on a bus. It kind of freaked us out a bit because half way in we looked around and noticed that a rather large number of our fellow passengers had medical ailments (stitches, broken legs, etc). Did we pass a hospital? On the way back we found out that yes, we had.

Our destination was Stanley Park. This was a Central Park-like park west of the city centre. It was also surrounded on three sides by water so there were plenty of views like this:

This city certainly felt the most Auckland-like of all the places we visited. Sure, Auckland doesn’t have a Central Park-like park but it’s coastal, and has a lot of building and boats.

Anyway, we had this big map of the park. What to see? The map identified one place that had totem poles. That’s something we haven’t seen before:

Not bad, not bad. I was pleasantly surprised about the colours. For some reason I thought they were mostly unpainted. We did read about some of their history. Most of them had the following history: “X person carved this Y decades ago to celebrate Z event.” Again, not sure quite what I was expecting.

So where to now? We figured we may as well continue walking through / around the park but nothing jumped out at us as being worth seeing. Eventually we decided to continue on to a lake called Beaver lake. This is what it looked like:

Yep, that’s a lake.

By this point we hadn’t been through that much of the park. But that didn’t mean we hadn’t walked a decent distance. And, this was only the first place we were planning to visit today. From here we were intending to walk into the city centre and on to the Gastown district (which sounds kind of interesting, doesn’t it?). And that was about a 3km+ walk.

> First we have to get out of this park

So, we set off.

Gastown is a kind of touristy district. Some interesting buildings etc. I set my Google Maps to take us to the Gastown steam clock. Here it is:

It was kind of interesting – seeing a clock operating from steam only. Well, presumably. I don’t remember what time we arrived (I guess we’ll never know) but it was five minutes until an o’clock. So we waited for the o’clock. Upon striking, it started playing a little song while releasing steam from the four corners at the top. Which naturally led to the following thought:

“We walked all this way – I really hope there’s more to do here.”

But before that, we decided to have lunch. Unbeknownst to Betty, I just happened to navigate us to a mall which just also happened to have a board game shop. What are the chances?

Okay, that’s not true – I knew exactly what was in the mall. Well, I knew one of the stores that was in the mall. I wasn’t aware that there was a movie cinema in the mall. After we had eaten, we were both a bit reluctant to go outside and do too much. We’d done so much walking. We figured, “Well, let’s just go and see what’s showing at the cinema.”

There were a couple of movies that Betty had her eyes on seeing but might not be showing upon our return to New Zealand. One was a scary crocodile movie that I didn’t want to see and I was praying that wouldn’t be showing here either. I can’t remember whether it was or not but the other – a semi-comedy (mostly drama) called The Farewell which somewhat explored what it was like to be Asian but raised in Western society – also happened to be showing. And it was showing in five minutes.

So we saw that.

And it was good. And probably a lot less scary than the crocodile movie.

And that’s really all we did this day (other than taking the bus back to North Vancouver)

This is not something that can be planned for but it is really nice when things just happen to work out perfectly. We just happened to be in a mall with a cinema, and just happened to finish lunch five minutes before the exact movie we wanted to see was showing, at a time that we wanted nothing more than to sit down for a while.

It makes it seem like it was just meant to be.

We’ve had a small number of days where things seem to be working against us. (Although to be fair, these have been minimal was we have been spoiled for things to do if our first choices fall through). It is really nice when things just work out. To be honest, this felt like it made our day which otherwise might have felt like a let-down.

I said that this is not something that can’t be planned for but it probably is due to the right planning. Our planning has allowed for situations like this to happen. Does that make sense? I think that’s my way of saying, “We’ve planned this trip really well.”

Not exactly thrilled that it’s coming to an end.
