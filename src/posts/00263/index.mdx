// Decided to go to the zoo, but it didn't open until 10 so left late. Hung around outside and said goodbye to the people we'd met who were leaving

// Zoo was free. Asked what the recommended donation was and they said "go see the park first"

// Lots of parrots, macaws.

// Tigers weren't doing too much

// The most interesting animal was probably the Binturong - known as a "bearcat" (although it is neither a cat nor a bear). I had no idea this animal existed. The fun fact is that they tend to smell a bit like popcorn or corn chips.

// Some of the monkeys had plastic baseball bats. It was rather frightening seeing them climb round holding these weapons - sometimes carrying them with their tail. They then slammed them into the perches, trying to snap them.

// Also interesting was the poison frogs. Very bright - especially the bumblebee variant

// Upon arriving back at the exit we noticed we hadn't seen the Miniature Zebu, so we did another loop of the park. Tigers were in the same position. Found the red eyed tree frog that we couldn't find earlier - it was on the underside of a leaf but was facing the glass. It would have been in full view but we didn't notice green on green. Miniature Zebu wasn't in its enclosure but we spied it out the back. It just looked like a regular cow.

// That killed two hours. Not ready for lunch yet so we headed to Rainbow Falls. The viewpoint was right beside the carpark and it wasn't that exciting. We climbed a hill toward what we thought was another viewpoint above the falls, but we couldn't even see the falls from there. Clearly there isn't a lot of water at the moment. But at the top of the hill we noticed some trees. I think we all independently stated something along the lines of, "these trees are better than the waterfall"

// Back to Cafe 100 for more Loco Moco - this time vege and chicken varieties

// Drove out to Akaka Falls. Made a stop at a viewpoint over the bay. Then took a scenic detour which turned out to feel a lot like a drive through a jungle. Thin road with lots of trees around.

// Stopped for a walk down to a bay.

// At Akaka Falls State Park, we parked 20 metres outside the park so we didn't have to pay the parking fees - but this was clearly okay because the parking lot was rather small and mostly full anyway. Still cost us $5 each.

// Some nice smelling plants on the way

// Like Rainbow Falls, Akaka Falls was a bit lacking in water. The rainy season is coming soon but I guess its not here yet. The viewpoint didn't seem to be the best - we couldn't even see the bottom - so we walked along trying to find another only to realise that there wasn't going to be another.

// Continued along to the Kahuna Falls, but couldn't really even see that. Annoyingly, the loop would clearly have been better in the other direction so we walked back the way we came. Overall it was perhaps the most disappointing stop and weird that this was the thing we paid money for - although maybe that was related.

// Stopped at a roadside stall and bought a coconut. $10 USD but gotta try it. Drank the juice then the guy chopped away the outer so we could eat the flesh. Both the juice and the flesh were not as strong as we were expecting

// Lastly we returned to Hilo to visit a Japanese inspired garden. Upon arriving we noticed that there were cats around. Looks like someone is feeding them. Approached a big group because we saw there were mongooses there. They did not look like a friendly animal. I guess the cats get enough food that they don't chase the mongooses - though some did appear interested in birds.

// Walked out to Coconut Island, which was nice but little more than a place for picnics. Learned some things about how high the waves have gotten in the past (27 feet in 1947 - check numbers).

// Walked around the Japanese Garden and then left.

// Stopped at Target to grab some dinner on the way home.
