Today we woke up to rain, and so we didn't do a lot.  Usually I wouldn't even bother with a blog post but at 3pm we noticed that the weather was actually not too bad.  But from previous experience we know that just because it isn't bad now it doesn't mean the skies won't dump an ocean on us once we start going for a walk.

We decided just to do a nearby walk that went along a creek.  Well, kind of.  The creek's name was Canyon Creek which turned out to be a pretty fitting name.  This walk followed the rim of that canyon as it got higher and higher, and further away from the creek.

> Can it really be called a "creek" when the canyon is this sized?  Surely it deserves a promotion.

There wasn't really an official end to this walk - the trail just followed the rim of the canyon for longer than we would want to walk.

I had read a comment that the trail is not worth following after the third viewpoint.  Which sounds like an easy enough instruction to follow.  But after walking along it we really had to question, what was a view point and what was not?

Is this a viewpoint?

What about this?

And this one?

Eventually we just decided to turn around because we'd had enough.

Overall this wasn't a walk we probably need to remember.  The canyon was kind of interesting I suppose, but not really as interesting as some of the other places we have visited.  Since nothing really notable happened then I guess I could have skipped writing this one.  But who knows, maybe in time we will forget that the walk was little more than a two hour walk in the rain.  Maybe we'll look back at the photos and think, "Oh - look at all the places we've been.  I'm sure glad we did that."
