We were up earlier than I was expecting this morning. This was probably because we're in bed early the night before. I know, very strange for us. Well the sun now sets at a normal hour and so with not much else to do when camping in the dark we might as well sleep. And if we're in bed early then it is somewhat natural that we get up early.

We have to drive on to Eugene, Oregon today and I'm not totally sure how we're going to get there (more on that later). However before then what we want is to spend a bit more time amongst the Redwoods.

The first walk we figured we'd do is Fern Canyon. It was highly recommended - a whopping 4.8 / 5 on Alltrails. To get there we had to drive on the dreaded Davison road. While the name was excellent, the road itself was unpaved. Fortunately it must have been graded recently because there was no washboarding. However at one point we had to cross a creek and at other points we had to cross puddles which were big enough that they may as well have been creeks. The road ended on the ocean side of the forest and so we began walking.

Like a lot of walks, Fern Canyon had a very literal name. This was a canyon lined with ferns.

There was an annoying lack of signs. This trail was supposed to be a loop of some kind. But how can a canyon walk be a loop? Well, we figured we'd start by hiking up the canyon.

It wasn't really a trail. Instead we walked, as best we could, on the parts of the canyon where there was no water. We didn't really want to get our feet wet if its not necessary.

> Apparently there are bridges here during the "on" season

Eventually we found a path that led up the canyon wall and then looped back around to the start. It was not a long walk, lengthened a bit by the time we had to take repeatedly crossing the streams as carefully as we could. The walk also wasn't as interesting as I expected. This is the most popular walk in the park? Perhaps we just came too early. Perhaps with more sun this might have given us the warm fuzzy feelings we got yesterday.

Next on our list was a trail at the beginning of Davison road.

> It also had an excellent name

This one was through another redwood grove to a waterfall called Trillium Falls. We figured it didn't matter if the waterfall was lacking - we were mostly here for the giant trees. Well, it's a good thing we thought that way.

> Can you even call this a waterfall?

But who cares? This was another nice stroll through a quiet and peaceful forest. We didn't have to walk the loop but we decided to do it anyway.

We lunched at Crescent City (and discovered that Taco Bell $2 burritos are just as good as there regular ones - if you pick the right ones anyway). Then we drove on to one last redwoods grove. It was also on a gravel road and like Davison road, it can get quite narrow in parts. I guess it's because have to go round and between all the giant old trees.

Stout Grove, like yesterday's Lady Bird Johnson Grove, was excellent.

I'm running out of ways to describe how nice these forests were. I'm not that creative of a writer.

But at least this is the last grove we are visiting.

> Goodbye trees - you've been excellent

For some reason Google Maps was refusing to direct us along the road to Grants Pass, which was clearly the most direct route to Eugene. Instead it wanted us to take the coastal road rather than join with the main highway. So we ignored the instructions for once. Five minutes later we discovered why Google Maps didn't send us this way.

The road was closed.

We had seen some signs about forest fires and so this must be related. Apparently they were piloting (whatever that means) vehicles through three times a day (not sure what happens in the evenings). The next time was 4pm. It was only 2:15pm now. The person told us, "Look you can either sit in your car in the hot sun for two hours. Or you can go back to the forest."

Is that even a choice? We could go the long way, or we could see more trees and then drive the straighter road.

> Except now I have to come up with more words to say how nice this place was

This was Simpson-Reed grove. We picked it because it was a grove and it was nearby. I only mention the name for the sake of completeness.

Something did happen while we were here though. We were walking along and we heard a big thump. "Did a tree just fall over?" we thought to ourselves. We went in the direction of the noise but couldn't figure out what fell. Then we realised exactly what we heard - a big thump, not an earth-shaking thump. It was probably just a branch falling off. That'd be hard to spot so we gave up looking.

We joined a queue of cars for Grants Pass with 15 minutes to spare. We didn't know what to expect but it became pretty clear there had been a fire here. I looked it up later and apparently in August lightning had lit at least 27 separate fires here. I guess they are still cleaning up the area - hence why cars are only allowed through at certain times.

The journey took a while, partially because we had to travel slow in the queue but also because the roads are really long in the USA sometimes.

Ten minutes after Grants Pass we were climbing a hill in the twilight and something happened. Our car did a big shudder - like something had gone wrong (as if there could ever be a good shudder). The "check oil" light came on immediately. Uh, what to do? Well I still seemed to have control over the car so we pulled over.

It doesn't seem like that long ago that we changed the oil but it certainly has been a lot of kilometres. We really have put this little car through a lot of strain in only a few months. I was already a bit paranoid that it would fail this close to the end of our trip.

We went over our options. If we could drive then we could turn around and drive back to Grants Pass. We could stay there the night and get our car looked at tomorrow. Well, I guess we better see if our car drives. So we turned it back on and it seemed fine. The oil light didn't come back on. So we started driving and it seemed okay. We figured, "Maybe we'll just continue on?"

We took longer than usual because for the next two hours I drove a good 10 kph below the speed limit. The next day our car started fine and we got an oil change and that was that.

We have been quite lucky that we never had any serious issues with our car. Sure we've had to have oil changes and a battery change, but those are entirely normal things to change. After all, we drove 34,000 kilometres in only six months. And also, let's face it - our car was nothing special. It wasn't some big vehicle designed for long distances - it was a small engine hatchback. But we picked it partially because Japanese cars have generally been reliable for us in the past. Plus we did deliberately seek out a car with low-ish mileage. Even though we don't know much about cars, I like to think we did make good decisions when picking this one.

We crept into our AirBnB quite late (it's great that self check-in is a thing). We picked this because it was dirt cheap, but were surprised to find a few goodies left for us. Betty often complains (only partially seriously I hope) that we're always picking the cheap places to stay. But these cheap places can still often provide nice experiences. On this trip it has been really nice that we've been able to travel round and stay at a wide variety of places.

By the end of our trip we will have stayed at 90 different motels, hotels, AirBnBs, and campgrounds. That's the advantage of not finding work I guess - we instead were able to travel wide and far. I wish I'd taken more pictures of the rooms. They would have made a nice montage of different layouts and decor. It will certainly be nice to have the comforts of home again - like microwaves and especially kettles. It will also be nice to walk into a bathroom and have some certainty as to how to turn the hot water on. Why are there so many different tap configurations?

So today has ended with us saying goodbye to California and the Californian redwoods. Next we plan to spend a bit of time in Oregon and Washington before crossing back to Vancouver. Thank you for reading this far, through all my ramblings about trees and bathroom fixtures. Hopefully you've enjoyed this as much as I enjoy revisiting our adventures.
