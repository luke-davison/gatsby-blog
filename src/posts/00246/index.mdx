What to do? What to do? Well we've deliberately picked some accommodation near Hollywood. Let's go see Hollywood! First stop, the most iconic feature of Tinseltown - the Hollywood Sign.

But first some info about the sign. Notably you can't exactly go there. The sign is located on a private ranch rather than in a public space. This kind of makes sense since after all the sign was originally erected as a real estate advertisement.

There are a couple of places which are thought of as "best" to view the sign. The first is Griffith Observatory - which is notable for being nowhere near the sign. Instead I decided we'd go to a public park somewhat under the sign. This park turned out to be in a very residential area. We had to navigate some very thin and windy roads, clearly built just for residential vehicles. Fortunately the park did have some road parking - the rest of the streets had nothing.

And here it is:

The park was little more than a sports field. It was a bit crowded around the entrance with people taking the exact same photo as above. I can't blame them for not walking further into the park. Based on the angle to the sign, going further into the park would only make the view worse.

We were in and out in about a minute.

But we're here. Is there anything else around? Well, the road went up a hill. And at the top was a much better sign view.

There was also a view out over the city of Los Angeles. Well, kind of.

Uggh. This is America at its worst. The city is barely visible in the haze. We also ought to be able to see the Pacific Ocean from here but it's completely hidden by the polluted air. Like the chaotic drivers yesterday, I sort of knew to expect this - but it was still a bit disappointing to be here seeing it.

// An extra 15 minutes of driving due to traffic, but we were in no rush.

// Stopped at park for Hollywood sign. A bit far away. Since it was such a short stop and a small park we decided to walk up the hill. A better view of the sign but not a good view of Los Angeles - too much air polution

// Decided to walk down the street to be a bit closer. A fence had been erected to block view of the sign. Got to a street that was "closed". A blog says this is just to stop cars but we decided we didn't want to cause trouble. Google Maps showed a walking path but we couldn't spot it. Found that a van was blocking the path entrance and making it look like just another house. Best view on this path.

// Very thin and windy road on the way down.

// $15 USD parking

// Walked several blocks to find Hollywood Boulevard. Walked along the Walk of Fame. Lots of people we don't know down here. A bit of a sketchy neighbourhood. Many homeless people and a surprisingly large number of lingerie shops (four).

// Street was a lot busier around the Dolby Theatre and Chinese Theatre. Looked around a huge souvineer shop. Saw the hand prints in front of the Chinese Theatre. Saw the best picture winners at the Dolby Theatre.

// Decided to walk to Hollywood Bowl. Hot and uphill. No one else there though, which was nice - except for a lady telling us we couldn't approach the strange

// Bought some slurpees for the walk back

// Then visited where The Office was filmed

// Walmart and back to accommodation. No near misses while driving today.
