We woke up - like as it often happens each morning. What to do? What to do? Well we've deliberately picked some accommodation near Hollywood. Let's go see Hollywood! First stop, the most iconic feature of Tinseltown - the Hollywood Sign.

But first some info about the sign. One problem - it's not a place you can visit. The sign is located on a private ranch rather than in a public space. The sign was originally erected as a real estate advertisement. I guess whoever bought it never bothered to take the sign down.

There are a couple of places which are thought of as "best" to view the sign. The first is Griffith Observatory - which is notable for being nowhere near the sign. Instead I decided we'd go to a public park somewhat under the sign. This park turned out to be in a very residential area. We had to navigate some very narrow curving roads, clearly built just for residential vehicles. Fortunately the park did have some road parking - the rest of the streets had nothing.

And here it is:

> This is the field we drove all this way to see!

The park was little more than a sports field. It was a bit crowded around the entrance with people taking the exact same photo as above. I can't blame them for not walking further. Going further into the park would not help.

We were in and out in about a minute.

But we've driven here. Is there anything else around? Well, the road went up a hill. And at the top was a much better sign view.

> A much better view of the word

There was also a view out over the city of Los Angeles.

> Well, kind of

Ughh. This is America at its worst. The city is barely visible in the haze. We also ought to be able to see the Pacific Ocean from here but it's completely hidden by the polluted air. Like the chaotic drivers yesterday, I sort of knew to expect this from Los Angeles - but it was still a bit disappointing to be here seeing it.

But we're not done with this sign. I'd read before that there were better places to see the sign. Except the locals don't want tourists walking round their neighbourhoods. The road continued toward the sign but a temporary but opaque fence got in the way of the view. But we walked down anyway. Then we got to a road that looked like this:

> Something tells me this road might be closed

Apparently the signs only relate to vehicle traffic, but we weren't in the mood for potential conflict so we turned back. The thing is, there was supposed to be a trail nearby - except we couldn't find it. There only seemed to be driveways about. Daring a risk of conflict I walked down one to look around a corner and found it wasn't a driveway - it was the path.

This was nice, especially because we could now turn our excursion into a loop walk.

Back at our car we noticed that things were starting to happen. There were now a lot more tourists about. We hadn't arrived early but apparently we were early enough to apparently beat the crowds. In addition to photographers and hawkers there were now also parking enforcement officers. Betty mentioned that parking was only for 15 minutes. I was like, "Oh is it?" I don't know how long we had been there but it was longer than 15 minutes. So we made a hasty exit.

From here we drove into central Hollywood - which involved navigating some even more narrow roads to get down out of the hills. We parked somewhere near where we thought we might want to be. This of course was somewhat wrong - so we had to walk a few blocks.

This is where I guess it's worth briefly talking about homelessness. All cities have people living rough but Los Angeles, or specifically Hollywood, seems to have a larger problem than most. I wouldn't have mentioned it but there was one particular part of the sidewalk we passed a jumble of things including an upright door frame. That's the first time I've seen a homeless person with a front door.

We were looking for the Hollywood Walk of Fame which is a series of ornamental paving stones with the names of celebrities. And it wasn't hard to find.

Hollywood is supposed to be the land of glitz and glamour, but reality seems to be quite different. The section of the Walk of Fame still seemed to be in a less-than-ideal part of town. Lots of shuttered shops, smoke shops, cheap souvenir shops, etc. Weirdly there seemed to be an unusual number of lingerie shops. We passed at least four.

We walked west along Hollywood Boulevard toward the most famous movie theatre - perhaps in the world. We had to go several blocks to get there so I kept an eye on the stars on the ground. And I couldn't help but notice something. There were no stars her for modern celebrities. Clearly they know what this part of the city is like and none want their in a place like this.

> Except for Winnie the Pooh - he doesn't care if he's outside a lingerie shop

The place we were looking for was the Dolby and Chinese theatres - two of the most famous places in cinema. Here is where we found a lot more celebrity names that we recognised. Here is where we also found the crowds and people trying to sell things to the crowds. We spent about 20 minutes in one shop which had a huge range of movie-related stuff of all kind. Name any animated movie character and you could probably have grabbed their face on a mug, shirt, pin, cap, or whatever. I was tempted by some near full size (but plastic) Academy Award replicas that were reasonably priced.

However we weren't just here to get Jack Skellington on a lunchbox. We headed nearby to the Dolby Theatre.

This is notable for being where the Oscars are awarded each year. In addition each Best Picture winner is inscribed on the pillars along the entryway.

This is a bit more glamourous. We sought out the pillar with the early 2000s, looking for the 2003 winner Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Unfortunately it was tucked in a weird place by one of the stairs - not a good place for a selfie.

What now? We'd kind of had enough of central Hollywood. I suggested we walk to the Hollywood Bowl - which is in walking distance if you think two kilometres uphill is a walkable distance. The Bowl is an open air amphitheatre which has been host to names such as The Beatles, The Jackson 5, Elton John, Linkin Park and Monty Python.

However we were more familiar with it from the 2008 Jim Carrey comedy described by RottenTomatoes.com as "dim and predictable" - Yes Man. In this film they broke into the Bowl (which we didn't need to do - it was freely open), stood on stage (but we got sternly told off when we tried to approach), then sat up in the rearmost seats (that we could do). Except it was hot and Betty wisely decided she'd prefer to stick to the shade rather than climb the steps. So I made the trek myself.

It was up here that I discovered why the filmmakers had picked these particular seats. There was gap in the hills which meant people sitting her could see the Hollywood Sign above the stage:

> Had to take this selfie style because someone didn't think climbing steps in the scorching sun was her idea of fun

It also nice that this place was not just free of tourists - it was almost completely free of any human people. I imagine that's a rarity in Los Angeles.

It took us a better part of an hour and a fair quantity of frozen slushy drinks to get back to our car. That's enough sight-seeing for the day, right? Well there was one more stop for us.

The Office is an American TV show that probably needs no introduction. It is a rare comedy show that seems like it might stand the test of time. It was the most streamed TV show in 2020, the year the whole world stayed inside watching TV. It is probably Betty's favourite TV series and in eight years of dating, we have watched the 201 episode series all the way through twice! Of course we had to come to where it was all filmed.

> The signwriting is new though

It's not a tourist attraction. It's just a building you can see from the street in what seems to be a very latino neighbourhood. There's nothing to do here but stand outside the gate. But even just the street, the hedge, and the nearby railyard are so identifiable from many episodes.

So that was Hollywood. It wasn't great. The writers and actors are on strike at the moment - perhaps that might be the reason for some of the lifelessness in the city. But of course it was still nice to see some of these sights.

Tomorrow will be another day and (spoiler) there will definitely be a lot more happening.
