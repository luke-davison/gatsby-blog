Check out this submarine sandwich I got from a Walmart.

> It was definitely “super”

Literally only purchased it because it was the longest in the store. The nutritional information called it five servings. Had ham, turkey, and beef. Was surprisingly delicious. Was both my lunch and dinner.

Update on the cookie cereal – it was okay. It makes a better snack than cereal.
