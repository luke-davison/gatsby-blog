This is the tale of two hikes at Bryce Canyon.

The first day we did the walk described in the park manual as “our most popular walk”. The next morning we did a walk barely mentioned in the park manual.

Bryce Canyon wowed us from the start. (It helped that the first stop we visited was called “Inspiration Point”). After walking the rim a bit, we then started a walk called the Queens Garden trail + Navajo Loop (this is the popular one).

The trail started by quickly descending down into a small slot canyon. It was late in the day and this part of the track was filled with dozens of tourists. But that didn’t really matter. The path was mostly big enough and the rock formations were wonderful to look at.

The track then led along the canyon floor.

And past some other interesting rock formations.

This part of the track was quieter but certainly just as interesting.

After making our way back up to the rim in the hot afternoon sun, we left Bryce Canyon with fond memories.

We woke up the second day a bit sore (as well as the track just mentioned, we had also done Angels Landing in Zion). Looking at the other tracks in Bryce Canyon, we selected one called Sheep Creek + Swamp Canyon. It was the only track sizeable enough to feel like a proper walk, but not too long.

It was in a part of the park we had not been yet. During the whole three hour hike, we barely saw anything or anyone else.

> Some rocks peeking through the trees

You’d think that would be nice. And it is. But as we walked, we realised why this track wasn’t very popular. There just wasn’t much to see.

> Unless you’re a fan of trees

We made it back to the car a bit unhappy that we had wasted three hours on a mediocre hike. (Which is unfair – the hike was fine, the other parts of the canyon were just much more interesting). Had this been our only hike in Bryce Canyon, or had we not been sore – this might have been a fine walk.

It’s a reminder that things are popular for a reason. Yes, you’re bound to run into scores of other people but it might be worth it to experience the best the park has to offer – especially in Bryce Canyon where crowds are never big enough to be problematic.
