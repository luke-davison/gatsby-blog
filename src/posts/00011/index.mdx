The third sign I took notice of while driving into Upper Hutt was for a place called “Staglands”. Didn’t know what it was – could have been a place for bachelor parties – but I decided that I’d look up. Then I forgot all about it. I knew I’d took notice of three signs, I just couldn’t remember what the third one was.

Fortunately we saw the sign again when coming back from the Remutaka walk. While having lunch I looked it up. It turned out to be a wildlife park. It was also reasonably priced, and with an average score of 4.7 / 5 on Google with over a thousand reviews (that’s very high for so many reviews) I figured we should check this place out.

It took a while to get there – we had to drive down a very tight road in a valley, halfway to Waikanae. We arrived somewhat late (2:30 pm maybe?). When we got out of the car we noticed something. I don’t know what they all were but a lot of (different) birds were making a lot of noise.

Paying to enter we also noticed that they were selling bags of “animal food” and “trout food”. Pfff – what kind of stupid thing is this? Do kids fall for this garbage? So we just bought two animal foods and went in :-).

The lawn at the front was filled with ducks, as well as some other birds. They all seemed pretty hungry. I shoved one of the bags in my pocket and we started feeding.

> Not sure again – perhaps we should have spent more time reading the info rather than enticing birds

> I think these were Chinese Geese

Don’t worry – plenty of ducks got fed too. So we’d spent 10 – 15 minutes and we hadn’t even left the first lawn yet. We started to move on. And that’s when we noticed we had a bit of an entourage.

![Image](img_20201127_140849.jpg)

> These guys decided they were coming too

Being late in the day there weren’t many other people around so I guess the various birds decided we were their best chance at food. And they began walking with us.

And that’s when I learned a new trick:

![Image](img_20201127_140946.jpg)

> I’m a princess

And Betty learned a new trick – that if she takes a picture just after the bird has flown off, I look ridiculous:

![Image](img_20201127_140950.jpg)

> Like, what am I doing?

Even the ducks and chickens with babies weren’t shy about being hand fed with their chicks around.

![Image](img_20201127_142131.jpg)

> This isn’t what it looks like. The duck in this photo ate the food from Betty’s hand. Betty isn’t trying to abduct one of the babies.

We soon after lost our tail of feathered friends and started exploring.

We came across some pheasants who didn’t seem interested in the food. We found a mute swan (it’s a type of swan, not just a quiet one) that tried chewing my finger rather than eating the food in my hand. Then we found some animals.

First there was this sheep:

![Image](img_20201127_142240.jpg)

After the cold, hard beaks of the birds it has really nice to feel the warm soft mouths and lips of this guy. Not sure why he eats the same food as the birds but like the birds he was very excited to have the pellets.

The next pen had some pigs and piglets. Betty enjoyed them as much as I enjoyed the sheep. Weren’t any good pictures so I’ll skip to the last pen which had nothing. Well, it was probably supposed to have nothing. Instead it had this marvellous peacock as well as a hen and her chicks.

The peacock clearly wanted the chickens gone (which was a bit unfair because clearly he wasn’t supposed to be here either). This was obvious by the raised feathers which he faced toward the chickens. He also did this thing where they all vibrated making this really unusual sound. I was unnerved.

![Image](img_20201127_142650.jpg)

> I think the top board in the gate is blocking all the chicks from view. Grr.

But the chickens weren’t, and they continued to ignore the peacock.

Eventually the wind got the better of him and he was forced to lower his tail feathers. After the show I was keen to reward the peacock but he appeared too proud to accept any of the food I threw his way. There had actually been a number of lady peacocks (which I happily fed) so it was nice to finally see a male one.

Next there was more pigs:

> Not sure why Betty likes pigs so much – she usually doesn’t eat bacon.

Then we entered a small aviary. We were immediately greeted by this guy:

![Image](img_20201127_143557.jpg)

We’d been to the alpine areas of the South Island – that’s where I thought we’d find Keas. It was a nice surprise to find one here.

![Image](img_20201127_143609.jpg)

And so curious he was. I got the (stupid) idea to see if he’d eat from my hat. It didn’t work. He seemed more interested in the hat than he did the food, grabbing and pecking at it a bit.

![Image](img_20201127_143853.jpg)

Being so close to such a majestic animal really solidified this day as a wonderful one. I think I was already having a lot of fun with the birds and the farm animals but this is the moment I can point to as confirming that this will probably be one of the best days of the trip.

Then we found a Pukeko. Ordinarily these birds are quite common, but that doesn’t mean I don’t like them. And they’re usually too shy to be hand fed.

![Image](img_20201127_143735.jpg)

> Such a lovely swamp chicken

Moving on from the aviary there were a couple of horses. Fortunately we spotted the signs saying “they bite” before trying anything stupid.

![Image](img_20201127_144224.jpg)

> No food for you sorry

Then we found another aviary. This one appeared very empty until Betty spotted a pair of Kereru (native New Zealand wood pigeon) nestled in the leaves of a tree at the edge of the path, right at head height. (No pictures sorry – too many leaves for anything to show)

Again, ordinarily a Kereru sighting would be great – never mind two in such a cute position.

Outside the aviary were a couple more pens. One had a mommy goat and two young goats. (For the record I know young goats are called kids but writing comments like, “Betty really liked these kids” might get a bit weird if seen out of context).

Betty really liked these horny animals.

![Image](img_20201127_145424.jpg)

I will agree – they were perhaps the softest animals we got to touch this day. Goats are also clearly quite intelligent. When they were struggling to fit their heads through the fence, they started pointing their heads toward the ground as if to say, “just chuck the food through”. They even managed to get through the fence at one point and the girls who had accidentally enticed them out had to pick them up and shove them back through.

In the adjacent cage was a daddy goat. Like his clever offspring he had a knack for encouraging food, by (somewhat violently) stroking his horns along the cage wiring as if to say, “hey, don’t forget I’m here too”.

![Image](img_20201127_145449.jpg)

> Don’t worry, he too got some food and some pats

Then we found another peacock. Two in one day – so lucky.

![Image](img_20201127_145513.jpg)

Next area had some more farm animals, including some sheep like the ones at the B&B. They too were super excited for human contact and to be fed.

![Image](img_20201127_145935.jpg)

Do the staff here not feed these guys? Is that why literally all the animals so far (except for those toothy horses and a couple of pheasants) were being super friendly? Do they just let the guests do all the hard work?

Also, are the animals just unusually hungry best of the pandemic? Being a tourist attraction, perhaps the lack of overseas tourists means they aren’t getting fed as much.

Next was a third peacock!

> This one I got to feed 🙂

Now we were getting to the main event. This place is called “Staglands” for a reason. Our hosts at the B&B mentioned that they were having deer problems. Deer were jumping their fences and eating their tasty fruit trees they’d just planted. Betty and I were like, “Oh no, how awful” while secretly hiding our enthusiasm. Unfortunately for us their dogs would scare the deer away. However at Staglands we could see them – and up close.

So we went into the large fenced area with the “deer” sign to find….

Mostly just a bunch of sheep and goats.

![Image](img_20201127_150648.jpg)

> Someone figured out that the food was coming from the pocket

You also may have noticed – I have been quite excited about the peacocks. Except then they started popping up increasingly. Now they were everywhere. The above photo was just supposed to be of a goat and yet no less than five peacocks photobombed me.

![Image](img_20201127_150723.jpg)

> Another in the background!

This was also the point where we had exhausted the first bag of food (we’d been carefully rationing it). While I was trying to get the last few pellets out, a goat promptly snatched it from my hand and ate it – bag and all.

![Image](img_20201127_150732.jpg)

> Goats are naughty

So we got out the second bag and promptly made it disappear into a pocket before the goat tried the same trick again.

![Image](img_20201127_151003.jpg)

> No don’t reward him. He’s been very naughty.

As I said, we were supposed to be here for the deer. There weren’t just goats, sheep, and peacocks. There was this guy:

![Image](img_20201127_152336.jpg)

> Nice hairdo

Fortunately he was separated by a fence. I took one look at those horns and decided he probably didn’t need any food.

There were also a couple of donkeys.

![Image](img_20201127_152230.jpg)

By this point we’d fed a bunch of animals but (with the exception of that swan at the start) we’d received no bites. Despite having teeth, the animals were all very gentle when being hand fed – opting to lick the food rather than bite. However I was worried this might change here.

But no, the donkeys were gentle too.

We now had two options, leave this enclosure, or to start up a path up the side of the hill that clearly went nowhere. We decided to do the latter and when we got high enough, we could see that the enclosure went quite far back. And we found these guys:

![Image](img_20201127_151330.jpg)

Only problem was that they were very far away. Also, the moment they spotted us as we came up the hill, they all stood up as if to run away. *Sigh*, oh well – suppose we should at least try to get closer.

Luckily a male eventually broke off and came up to us. He received his reward.

![Image](img_20201127_151411asdf.jpg)

> Why are all these animals so hungry?

![Image](img_20201127_151438.jpg)

> Bravery is rewarded

The other deer did seem kind of interested. But they mostly all kept their distance. Eventually we were able to coax a couple of take some food.

![Image](img_20201127_151842.jpg)

At this point it was starting to rain slightly so we decided that it was about time to head back. This was the furthermost point from the park entrance after all. However as we were leaving, one of the ostriches / emus decided that they wanted food too.

I’d kind of dismissed them earlier because they didn’t seem interested. Plus I was a bit scared of their huge beak. But, “may as well try” I thought to myself.

![Image](img_20201127_152423.jpg)

Overall not painful at all – though still a bit scary.

Betty also couldn’t resist giving some of the little goats some more attention too on the way out.

![Image](img_20201127_152552.jpg)

So that was Staglands. Very likely this will end up being the most fun we’ll have on this holiday. I’d recommend this to everyone and am half surprised our B&B hosts weren’t recommending it since their guests should all be animal lovers.

(Fun fact – they did tell us stories about people that booked their accommodation but didn’t care about the animals or complained that it was located out in the countryside. I can understand not liking the rooster at 6 am in the morning but who would not like these lovable creatures?)

When we got back to the B&B we kind of didn’t tell them what we’d done. Anything we said would feel to me like, “Thanks for letting us feed your animals. They weren’t that great so we had to go feed other animals instead.” Obviously we both know this is silly and our hosts wouldn’t have reacted in such a way.

…but we never did tell them.
