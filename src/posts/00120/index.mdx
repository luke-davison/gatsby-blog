I just want to say (to those two of you who will probably read this) a moment of praise for Bright Angel Lodge – our accommodation provider in the Grand Canyon National Park.

It’s listed on Google as a “1 star hotel”. This criminally undersells it. Sure we had shared bathrooms, but the room decor was the best we’ve seen so far.

And this was the view 5 metres away from our cabin.

> Hmm – this was a very Betty heavy blog entry. Not sure how Betty managed to get into all the photos I took of the room and of the view outside.
