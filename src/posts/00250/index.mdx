This morning we decided to head to something on our "do not miss" list - Griffith Observatory. It was also featured in the movie Yes Man.

We chose to park in the free parking by the Greek Theatre (which is probably famous but we didn't pay it any attention) then walk up. Up on a hill the observatory had some decent views over the city. Or it ought to.

Apparently this is one of the best places to view the Hollywood sign?

We were hoping to actually visit the Observatory but it wasn't going to open until noon. There was a large group of people having a yoga class on the lawn which made me wonder, "Why would you want to come somewhere so populated to do yoga?" We decided to take the long way back, which ended up being much longer because we missed a turnoff. There was supposed to a bird sanctuary here but I don't think the birds cared to stick around. They weren't the nicest of hills.

Afterwards we drove round to the Old Los Angeles Zoo. This was an area of the park that used to be the zoo up until 1966.

There wasn't really much to see here.

> Just a bit eerie

But then why did we come here? Well we were now killing time. We had an event scheduled for this afternoon and we had anticipated that we would spend longer at the observatory. In fact, until now we had been regretting making the booking so early. How did neither of us think to check the observatory opening time?

We had booked this:

While not disappointed with the Universal Studio tour, it was certainly lacking \*something\*. Well, Warner Brothers has the highest rated studio tour in Los Angeles.

So we spent some more money. This is certainly working out to be a very expensive couple of days. Fortunately we could avoid a parking fee just by parking in the suburbs and walking.

Entering the foyer we were greeted with a reminder that Warner Brothers has done very well for itself recently.

As I am writing this, Barbie has apparently made 1.4 billion dollars in ticket sales worldwide. A lot of people went to see this movie (myself included). Of course they're going to have pink things here for people to see.

> "She's having the BEST DAY!"

We checked ourselves in and were let into a dark room filled with info boards telling the history of Warner Brothers and the lot. It wasn't all that interesting - but they did have some posters for Lord of the Rings. That was a bit of a surprise. Wasn't that New Line Cinema? Well whatever the reason it's now Warner Brothers.

In the next section we just had to wait in an area decorated with foreign posters.

Then we got led into a cinema and shown a short film about Warner Brothers. I guess this is what we paid for after all. "Warner Bros" is in the title of the tour. I was surprised that they put a trailer before this short film. I can't remember what it was now - some TV series.

Then we were introduced to our tour guide and taken outside to an awaiting tour cart. We were then taken....

...

...into some trees.

Our tour guide started explaining various scenes in various movies that were filmed here. The only one of note was Jurassic Park - but just one scene was filmed here. In was amazingly unremarkable. But that does make a lot of sense. If it is unremarkable then it can be reused for a lot of different scenes. However it wasn't very exciting to see.

After the "Jungle" section our tour guide asked us what movies or TV series we liked - that way she could point out where they might have been filmed. No one really knew what to say, but eventually some titles were said.

Betty yelled out "Lord of the Rings". And you know what happened? Our tour guide responded, "Oh - that was filmed in England. ...and maybe some in New Zealand."

Um, what? How does this lady not know LOTR was filmed in New Zealand? I think in that moment she lost a lot of credibility in our eyes.

From the Jungle we were taken back to the area of the studio that actually looks like a studio. In the distance we spotted the Warner Brothers water tower.

> The pink logo was of course a Barbie thing

I don't know how many times I have seen this water tower in Looney Tunes cartoons and other media. It's pretty famous. Of course hopefully there's a lot more famous things to see.

The next section was a New York style street set.

> Much easier than filming on the other side of the country

Unlike the Universal Studios tour, we actually stopped and were able to walk around. The tour guide listed various stuff that had been filmed here. Again, most of them we didn't know. I guess the movies we like are just a small percentage of all movies. However some outdoor scenes for Friends were filmed here. Betty's ears did perk up when Gilmore Girls was mentioned though. However at the end was an area where they filmed the famous Spider-Man upside-down kiss in the rain.

> An iconic scene, although without the movie magic it does just look like a regular alleyway

Apparently this columned building has been used a lot - notably in the Batman tv series.

Then we were taken to the sound stages. I don't know how many there were but it seemed like a lot more than Universal.

![Image](PXL_20230928_210905808.jpg)

A sound stage is essentially just a big building that can be used for many purposes. On plaques outside each sound stage was the movies and tv shows that had been filmed inside. The two we parked outside had recently contained Friends, and Big Bang Theory - TV doesn't get bigger than that.

![Image](PXL_20230928_212403215.jpg)

We were taken inside the former Big Bang Theory soundstage which now held sets for a new TV series called Bob Hearts Abishola.

I'm not sure anyone in our tour group had heard of it - never mind watched it.

So not the best - however it did give some insight into how tv shows like this are filmed. All the sets are next to each other by a "camera alley" which the cameras can be wheeled along. The sets were a lot smaller than I was expecting. It made me wonder how big the Friends apartment might have been. I guess things just look bigger on TV.

We weren't allowed to take pictures here which is a bit of a shame. We couldn't even see much - much of the furniture was covered in sheets. I guess the strikes at the moment have put the studio into a sort of sleep-mode. We were allowed to ask questions and we all just peppered the guide with questions until she told us we had to move on. She claimed that tv laughter is not canned - a claim which is undoubtedly false so she lost a bit more credibility.

Next was a more Europe-y city setting. Lots more Gilmore Girls locations.

Betty's eyes lit up when this rotunda was pointed out.

> Something probably important happened here - I wasn't paying attention

There was also an exterior for the Full House house.

> It's at the end there - looking a bit worse for wear

The tour guide did acknowledge that the real house was in San Francisco (which is what most of the exterior shots are of) but perhaps there might have been a few scenes filmed on the doorstep here.

And that was about it for the guided tour. Like the Universal Tour it was about an hour long but it was so nice that we could get out and walk around in some of the sets. It was also nice that we didn't get attacked by 3D dinosaurs or have to engage in 3D street races.

However this was not the end. Sure, we had to say goodbye to the cart and the tour guide who doesn't know Lord of the Rings - but there was an extra non-guided part of the tour...

Which I will save for the next blog post...
