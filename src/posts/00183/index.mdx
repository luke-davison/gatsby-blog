In my original plan we were going to be camping in Rocky Mountain National Park tonight.  This would be very useful for two reasons.  The first was that it would allow us easy access to the park.  This park gets a lot of visitors so they limit entry to the park, and to the most popular parts of the park.  Fortunately our camping reservation would allow us to bypass those limits.  The other useful reason is that we could visit on two days but never have to go away and come back so we'd get to spend more time around nature.

However, a week beforehand we looked at the weather forecast and noticed it was likely to be very cold overnight in the park (1 - 2 degrees Celsius).  This spooked us a bit.  We didn't know if we would be prepared to camp in basically freezing temperatures.  We decided to play it safe and book a motel elsewhere rather than risk getting cold.

Despite no longer planning to camp, we obviously still wanted to visit the park.  Since we were relying on our camping reservation to give us access, we decided not to cancel it.  Fortunately US National Park camping fees are rather cheap so we weren't losing out on much.

But we discovered that our camping pass only gave us access from 1pm.  And of course it wouldn't be useful for any other day than today.  So really, we only had one afternoon to visit and enjoy Rocky Mountain National Park.  Oh well, we'll make do.

But that did mean that we needed an activity for the morning.  So we decided to return to Red Rocks - since that was a place we could only visit in the morning.  We went straight to the amphitheatre, which was open for visitors this time.

> The rocks have good acoustics apparently

There were a lot of employees around, doing various things to either pack up from the previous concert, or to prepare for the following concert.  There were also a lot of other people about.  And oddly, most did not appear to be tourists.  It looks like locals love using this place as an outdoor gym.  I guess the seating is basically a series of giant steps, which is a useful exercise?  Not sure - we didn't hang round to watch.

> "Hooray, music!"

What we did do was a trail that made a bit of a loop around some of the rocks.  There wasn't much of note to the walk, other than it was incredibly hot.  We also had the displeasure of doing all of the down parts first, and then having to walk all the way back up after we had already become hot.

And boy was it hot.  After having a few snow days we'd kind of forgotten how hot it gets down here at lower altitudes.

After a lunch and resupply stop, it was now time to head to Rocky Mountains.

As we were still a bit early we found a walk that was technically outside the park.  But when we got there I realised that I had accidentally underestimated the length.  I had seen the length in sections, most of which were less than a mile.  But when you add them all up twice (got to walk back too) and then convert to kilometres, it was actually quite a distance.  There were other things we definitely wanted to see this afternoon so we couldn't just spend all our time on this walk.

So we didn't do that walk.  Instead we made our way into the main portion of the park.  Our camping pass let us in as we had hoped.

As we were driving along, I spotted a person standing on the side of the road.  Then I spotted what they had spotted and made a hasty u-turn.

Across the stream was a moose.  Not a big moose, but definitely not a moose to trifle with either.  I had heard that there were moose in this park, but only that they were in the west of the park which we would not have time to visit.  In our last trip to North America we failed to see a moose - so it was nice that we can now say that we have seen one.

Well, not one.  Three.  Hiding in the bushes were two smaller mooses.  Hmm, spell checker says that is wrong.  Meese?  Wow that word is correct?  Seriously - that was just supposed to be a joke.

We couldn't get a good picture of the little ones because they were on the other side of a stream, and also - kind of not supposed to approach animals that can technically kill you.  But unfortunately that didn't stop people from trying.  Some crept through the bushes to the edge of the stream to snap a good picture.

It looked like the mother moose had kind of trapped herself.  There was a fenceline she couldn't get past behind her and a stream in front of her.  She did eventually try fording the stream, but it was clear to me this would not work because it was too deep for her calves to follow.  She then came up on our side of the stream.

And this is where this story gets angry.  One of the photographers by the stream had completely ignored the fact that the mother moose had crossed, and was focused on continuing to photograph the young ones.  After a few minutes, the mother moose started heading back to the stream and naturally was quite upset there was an unknown person near her babies.  I figured it was his own fault if he got caught, but at the same time I didn't want my holiday to be ruined by an idiot being trampled to death.  I think at the last minute the fool did hear our shouting and dived into the bushes to some form of safety.

So that was annoying.  Clearly a moose is a pretty big deal to other people, as well as us.  It caused a lot of people to gather round, and a lot of slowdown of traffic.  All of that is fine and somewhat unavoidable.  It was just a real shame that some people tried to get close.

But we didn't come here to be angry at people.  We came here to walk.  Although at this point in the day the clouds decided to open up and it started raining.

We decided to walk anyway.

The first lake was okay.

The rain was just light enough that spirits remained high.

> Surprisingly

Very quickly we started finding patches of snow on the path.  These patches sometimes made it hard to work out what is supposed to be track and what is not.  Usually we just had to resort to following the mass of footprints.  This was a popular walk after all so to start with the snow had all been stomped into a solid, walkable (if slippery) path.

It's a wonder it wasn't colder.  This was literally the park we are avoiding staying in because its too cold.  It is currently raining and we are surrounded by snow - not sure why we weren't freezing.

![Image](PXL_20230531_220102366.jpg)

Throughout the walk we were being passed by people going in the opposite direction.  Obviously they started walking an hour ago when it was fine, and now that it is raining they are making the wise decision to head back.  Many of these people were clearly not prepared for how slippery the packed snow can become.  Although, we didn't really have anything special either.  Perhaps we were just more used to it.

> Second lake was more scenic than the first.

We were now coming to the final third of the hike.  This was the part that several people had noted was too hard to attempt.  No longer was the track alternating between trail and snow.  Now it was all snow with no sign that there was a trail anywhere at all.  There were also a lot less people.

At one point we came to an area where some hikers were struggling to figure out where to go as the footprints led off in several different directions.  Out of instinct I just followed the dirtiest snow, which would indicate where the most people have stepped, but then stopped because apparently they found a route somewhere else.  On the way back we found that the dirtiest snow was in fact the most direct route so yah, I was right.

At the end of the trail we came to Emerald Lake, which was the final lake on the trail.  This lake was tucked in a pocket of mountains and clearly had remained much colder than the previous parts of the trail.  There was still a single large slab of ice covering most of the lake surface.  But fortunately for us, the slab of ice was far from the shore so we didn't get tempted to do anything stupid.

![Image](PXL_20230531_224151312.jpg)

We spent quite a while at this lake shore.  We had arrived at the same time as four other people, but that was it.  No one was there before us and basically no one arrived while we were there.  After crossing paths with a lot of people on the trail, it was really nice for it to be so quiet at the final destination.  I guess we have the weather to thank for that.

![Image](PXL_20230531_225919310.jpg)

We ended up chatting to the four other people.  They were all Floridians, or former Floridians.  They were all also very impressed with the scenery.  I joked that surely there were mountains like this in Florida (obviously a joke since its all hot and swampy) but my combination of foreign accent and mumbling meant none of them understood what I was saying.  Betty found this very amusing.

The weather was a lot finer on the way back so we stopped at many of the same places we stopped at earlier to take better photos.

> There used to be a lot of clouds and rain here

The lakes were a lot more still now

> Much better reflections

And technically Betty did managed to get her dream of standing on an icy lake.  This patch of snow appeared to overhang the water, so we figure that counts:

![Image](PXL_20230601_000210566.jpg)

Since the weather was finer again, we were getting a few more people coming the other way on the trail.  Although, at one point we looked ahead and this lady was coming towards us: 

![Image](PXL_20230601_000825242.jpg)

Not sure if this is an elk or a regular deer, but it was certainly huge.  I can't remember exactly, but it might have been the same height as me.  It was just walking slowly, but it stopped when it saw us.  We were in a bit of a stalemate.  We both wanted to get past.

We quickly decided to scamper up the nearby hill and the deer eventually decided that we were far enough away to walk past.

![Image](PXL_20230601_000928736.jpg)

It was getting a bit late in the day (still plenty of sunlight left though) but since we wouldn't be coming back here again, we decided to fit in one more walk.  We picked out a short-ish one to a waterfall.

![Image](PXL_20230601_005655280.jpg)

It was fine, but definitely not as special as the lake walks we'd just done.

On the way back out of the park we spotted the moose again (sadly still basically trapped between the fence and the stream again) as well as several more deer.

![Image](PXL_20230601_013735673.jpg)

And then it was time to drive on.  We still had a bit to drive as our accommodation wasn't nearby.  By the time we got there it was well past dark.  I think this is only the third time we've driven at night and it definitely isn't a comfortable experience to be driving in the dark in a foreign city in a foreign country - but it was worthwhile to be able to get to experience more of Rocky Mountain National Park.

Today was certainly a day of weather extremes.  A really hot walk in the morning and then one of the iciest walks we've done in the afternoon.  Overall a memorable day.

Not sure what we'll be getting up to tomorrow but that is a problem for us to figure out tomorrow.
