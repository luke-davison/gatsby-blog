I’m going to spend the next blog post unfairly hating on Zion. Before I do that I am going to take the time to show off Zion’s beauty.

Zion, like Yosemite, is another National Park where most of the good stuff takes place inside a giant canyon. Zion is much smaller than Yosemite, but that just makes its towering red stone walls seem all the more impressive.

Outside the canyon is very desert-like

But inside the canyon is quite lush, thanks to the high canyon walls and the river that runs through it.

Zion is also the place where we’ve seen the most wildlife. As well as squirrels and chipmunks, deer are plentiful and aren’t too nervous about being near humans.

It has numerous hiking opportunities

Overall it’s a great place to visit. Now time to grumble about it…
