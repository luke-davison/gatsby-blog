So today we woke up and it was fine again.  That was unexpected.  Wasn't the weather supposed to be bad?  Well, we'd better make the most of it.... again.

Today we picked out a walk to a waterfall called Lineham Falls.  We partly picked this one because it noted that the first part of the walk was through berry patches - "Prime bear territory" the description notes.

Well there was no bears today.  Not even any berries.  I guess the early bear gets the early berry and then leaves apparently.

The trail started as a slow climb.

A while ago I had decided that he wanted to re-watch that animated spider hero movie that we saw only 10 days ago.  Well, the township of Waterton Lakes actually had a cinema and at 8pm they were currently playing Across the Spiderverse.  So that's how Luke spent an evening while Betty stayed home and didn't re-watch an amazing movie.  After the movie Luke did have to walk home in the pouring rain.  Fortunately Betty was considerate and drove to pick him up.  Unfortunately she mistimed her departure and Luke was already most of the way back already.  But fortunately he did have the foresight to bring an umbrella.
