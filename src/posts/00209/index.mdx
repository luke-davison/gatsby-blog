Today didn't get off to a quick start.  While we're usually going to be camping, some motel nights are sprinkled amongst the nights spent in a tent.  For the next three nights we'll be camping in Jasper National Park, which presumably would have no cellphone coverage, never mind WIFI or even power.  So this morning we delayed our departure as long as possible in order to spend extra time using the internet to research things we might want to do.

After three hours of driving, and one hour stopping to eat and buy more things to eat, we arrived at Jasper.  Since it was mid afternoon and not raining we figured we may as well set up our tent first.  Then since it was still mid afternoon and not raining we figured we'd better get some walking done.  In our morning internet using we had noticed that the fine weather we were having today might not last - so better make the most of it.

The walk we picked out was in the Edith Cavell Glacier area, which involved a long slow drive up a twisty road.  That sounds bad, but here's a little secret...

Every metre of up we drive, is one less metre of up we have to walk.  Shh, don't tell anyone.

As a result, the start of the trail looked like this:

> Rocks!

This is a place we've been to on our last trip to this continent.  But last time we basically only did the easy walk to the view point, then we left.

> The sign doesn't expressly say we can't get closer, but the fence does strongly dissuade doing so

Well this time we plan to do the harder walk to... actually, we weren't sure where we were walking to.  But as you may have noticed in previous blog posts, we've been relying highly on aggregated user reviews on AllTrails to tell us which walks are good and which ones are not.  This walk had an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.

![Image](PXL_20230630_225820995.jpg)

> Numbers!

Here's how the system works:

* less than 4.4 - either average or not worth doing
* 4.4 to 4.5 - good, but might not be anything spectacular, like a trail around a lake
* 4.6 - these are good, worth doing unless there are higher trails
* 4.7 to 4.8 - the best trails, with the best views, that we're basically guaranteed to enjoy if we can stand the distance
* 4.9 and higher - nothing is ever ranked 4.9 because there's always sour people who can't be pleased.  If the average ranking is this high, probably only 12 people have ever walked it

Jasper had a lot of walks around 4.6, but this one was a 4.7.

> Oooooooh

For context, nothing in Elk Island was rated higher than a 4.3.  Which sounds sad, but that's just how geography works.  Elk Island didn't have anything like this:

While some of this walk was amongst trees, the majority of it ended up being above the treeline.  And the exciting thing about being above the treeline is that this area is the home to one of Betty's favourite critters - the hoary marmot:

![Image](PXL_20230630_234425239.jpg)

> More like "hooray marmot"

They have such a shaggy, multi-coloured coat, and are often quite content to be near hikers - so they're always a nice sight to see.  On this trail we managed to spot three.

This walk was to a pair of viewpoints.  The first one was relatively close to the glaciers... which I now realise I haven't talked about yet.  Edith Cavell Glacier is actually a pair of glaciers.  One is high up on the rockface, and dangles down like a melted piece of cheese.  The other partially surrounds the lake at the bottom and is less impressive, but easier to see.

![Image](PXL_20230630_235406485.jpg)

This trail allowed us to get higher than we did in 2019, so we could see more of the upper glacier, as well as seeing it from some more scenic angles.

> Silly pose!

We weren't really seeing anything we couldn't see from the lower viewpoint, but walks like this are still an easy 4.7 rating.  They're less populated than the flatter walks (though we're certainly not alone), but if they don't go too high above the treeline then they also won't require scrambling over scree.  And being just above the trees, you get guaranteed views of the neighbouring mountains:

Unfortunately the second viewpoint was a bit higher.  This one was up on a ridge.  While there was a clear path to follow, it was frequently quite steep and not all that grippy.  As we hiked up, there was a girl coming down that was having trouble due to the heights and lack of stability.  She had only managed a couple hundred metres by the time we passed her on the way back down.  If the whole walk was like this, it might not have been a 4.7.

This viewpoint gave us a better view of the upper glacier, although we could no longer see the lake at the bottom.

![Image](PXL_20230701_003252857.jpg)

We also had a better view of... well, everything.

![Image](PXL_20230701_003315656.jpg)

This was not a viewpoint that allowed us to see anything in particular.  But it is really nice to be up here and stare out at the park.  We basically just sat and stared for fifteen minutes.

> Well, we were also recovering from all the uphill walking

On the way down we got some better views of the lake.  We hadn't spent much time looking over it because at the time it had been relatively overcast.  But now the skies were rather blue, so the bright colour of the water shone much nicer.

Apparently at this time I was also testing out different ways for us to take selfies.  Rather than using the front-facing camera (which is too easy), I tried the back-facing one which has better quality and zoom options.  But clearly the zoom that I had it on was not intended for selfies because it kind of \*warped\* my arm a bit.

![Image](PXL_20230701_012006740.jpg)

> That arm definitely looks like its bent the wrong way

On the way down we also spotted another new-to-us animal friend.  It looked like a mouse:

![Image](PXL_20230701_013128246.jpg)

> A bit camouflaged, but rocks aren't that furry

What it actually was was a pika.  According to the paper guide for the park, they are more closely related to a rabbit then a mouse.  I don't know if I believe that.  Can you honestly look at those small round ears and tell me this is rabbit-like?

We also saw more chipmunks:

![Image](PXL_20230701_013208746.jpg)

On our walks we tend to see a lot more chipmunks than squirrels.  I guess squirrels are found where there are a lot of trees (well, except for ground squirrels) whereas chipmunks can frequently be found in the rocky alpine areas.  If we are at a viewpoint somewhere, often it is chipmunks that are running around trying to steal food from our bags.

So that was about it for this walk.  It took us several hours and it was now into the early evening.  Time to go back to the campground.

If I was to rate this walk on AllTrails (which I don't do because I'm lazy, even though the ratings provide such good value to us) it would be getting a 5.  It won't be our most favourite walk of our trip, but it will definitely be up there.  Any walk where we get blue skies with views of mountains, lakes, glaciers, and trees that is neither too crowded nor too hot is definitely a good walk.  I don't know if there's too many more like this in Jasper National Park.  But since we're here for three nights, we'll likely know soon.
