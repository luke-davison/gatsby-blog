So it turns out that Luke from 24 hours ago doesn’t know anything. He claims that he likes the valleys. He claims he likes looking up at the Valley walls. Apparently he has never been to Sentinel Dome.

When deciding what to do today, we decided to drive out of the canyon and up to a place called Glacier point (spoiler: there’s no glacier there, but there is a point). Before we got there, we pulled over to do a short walk to and up Sentinel Dome which, like it’s name, is a huge dome shaped rock.

The views were amazing.

> Upper and part of Lower Yosemite Falls

The valley of Yosemite National park is a pretty place. But Yosemite is more than just the valley. And we could see it all from the top of Sentinel Dome.

> Half Dome rock on the left. Betty is also in the photo somewhere.

Described as “360 degree views”. Never has that phrase been more true.

> The rock face on the right is called “El Capitan” and is climbable

We did get a bit sweaty hiking up there – though the car did most of the work.

> We’re heading over those mountains

But we had a time limit today so eventually we had to drag ourselves away.
