It's time to answer the big question. Is Hawaii part of North America? USA is a North American country and Hawaii is part of USA. But its located near the middle of the biggest ocean on the planet. That doesn't sound like its part of any continent, never mind North America. To sum up, I have no idea.

We had flown into Honolulu the night before. We arrived after dark to find the airport strangely empty of places to eat. Air Canada hadn't provided us with meals and we were a bit peckish. Fortunately a 7-11 near our accommodation was the solution. Open 24 hours it served a range of Hawaiian food - which seems to be a mixture between American and Japanese cuisine. The best example is spam musubi which is a piece of spam with nori holding it onto an oblong of rice. I didn't try this though as the chicken sushi sandwich thing looked too good to pass up.

We were up the next day rather early. This is because I still had my phone on Vancouver time. I woke and saw 10am and thought, "Oh, I'd better get up." But no - it was only 7am.

Honolulu has a very different climate to what we're used to. It has this thing called humidity. For the last five months we've often stuck to dry mountain and desert areas so we weren't sure how we were going to fare against hot and humid Honolulu. We decided to start today with a simple walk to Manoa Falls.

This may have been a mistake. On paper the walk is rather straightforward - a mere 2.7 kilometres. However it was more uphill than I was expecting. Also the trail ran through the rainforest. While it was somewhat pleasing to look at, the humidity was even higher than what it was back in town.

This might also be an appropriate time to mention that we're not travelling alone here in Hawaii. We have company. Dad has been invited on this trip for a few reasons. The first is that I haven't seen him in a a while. The second is that he hasn't had an overseas holiday in an even longer while. The third is that Hawaii has a lot of those geocache things that he likes to collect. And there is a fourth reason but we won't get into that right now.

So regularly along the trail we had to stop while he snuck into the trees to try and find some geocaches. Unfortunately the key word here is "try". Something was going wrong today as I don't think he found any of them. The coordinates were just random places on the side of the trail. In a jungle this thick, a small geocache container could be anywhere. Something also might have been going wrong with his GPS.

Fortunately the stops were a chance for us to recover. Or so we thought. Very quickly these stops became a chance for us to get bitten by bitey bugs. For some reason I hadn't considered that insect repellent would be a thing we would need. We had some back on the mainland but I got rid of it.

The waterfall was a bit lacking.

So this walk wasn't a success. This was just supposed to be a test walk to see how people would cope with the heat and while I was fine, Betty and Dad were not. So we figured we'd drop by the supermarket and pick up some supplies then head back to our accommodation. Except we figured we'd walk to the supermarket.

While it was downhill and no longer amongst the rainforest, it was in the mid morning sun. When we arrived at the supermarket we needed a sit-down first before we could do any shopping. However some cold drinks perked us all back up again. I don't think Dad had tried blue Powerade before but he seemed to enjoy it. And of course he would - it's cold and liquid.

Prices at the supermarket were a bit of a shock. We were used to prices being the same in USA as they would be in NZ (but in USD rather than NZD) but in Hawaii stuff was even more pricier. $8 USD / $13 NZD for an otherwise ordinary box of cereal? I suppose that's what happens when you combine the high value of United States currency with the remoteness of a Pacific Island.

Back at our accommodation everyone rested while I blogged. I was two months behind with writing my blog posts (and looking at the publish date on this one, very little has changed since).

We were only going to be in this part of Hawaii for a couple of days. Wanting to maximise our time here I decided we should see Diamond Head - which was at the top of my things to see in the Waikiki area. After thinking about it, everyone else decided to tag along (possibly because there was geocaches there). So we grabbed some Subway lunch and headed off.

To get to Diamond Head we took an Uber - our fourth since arriving in Honolulu. Public transport is pretty cheap but sometimes it's just worth paying extra for the convenience and speed of an Uber. It's also nicer than taxis because we can order and pay through the app - knowing how much it will be in advance. Plus when the price is effectively split three ways it doesn't seem so bad.

Diamond Head is strangely dry compared to the lush rainforest we saw this morning. Why? Not sure. It's probably because this area has a lot more volcanic rock which make things hard to grow. The yellow grass is actually an invasive species so that isn't even supposed to be here.

// Got up at 7am. This was partly because I checked the wrong phone and thought it was 10am (which it was in Vancouver)

// 7 Eleven breakfast. Also it rained a bit.

// Caught an Uber out to Manoa Falls. It was a lot cheaper than yesterday - less than a US dollar per minute of driving

// Hike to Manoa falls was through a rainforest. Lots of bamboo and other exotic plants. Also lots of water dripping from everything. It rained a bit but that didn't account for all the water dripping and flowing along the path. Waterfall was a bit lacklustre. Also bugs.

// Dad tried to find several geocaches along the path but GPS was giving him trouble.

// The walk wasn't hard but everyone (else) was a bit tired. This was supposed to be a test so it was a bit worrying that it had been so hard. We decided to walk down to a supermarket and then go back to our accommodation. This was 30 minutes of walking in the mostly sun. When we got to the supermarket we had to sit down for a long while before even going inside. Food was expensive

// We decided we really wanted to go to Diamond Head. Dad initially told us to go without him but eventually decided he could come along. Third Uber trip of the day - also cheap.

// We arrived 3:15-ish. We had to reserve a slot and all the morning slots had been taken. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the late hour meant that parts of the path were shaded by the crater wall. Otherwise it would have all been in the sun.

// Dad doing geocache questions along the way. Tunnel then views

// Nice view from the summit out over Waikiki. However I noticed Dad had seemingly given up and sat down 10 steps from the top. It turns out it was a strategic sit so he could fish underneath the step for a geocache.

// While we enjoyed the time at the top, Dad went to check out another viewpoint then started back the way we came. This was odd since it was supposed to be a loop. It turned out we could squeak underneath a part of the structure. We weren't sure whether Dad didn't see it or he decided he didn't want to do it. So we went down and just met up with him down the steps. It turns out it was the "didn't see it"

// Lots of shade on the way down, plus more geocaches

// Walked through a tunnel to a viewpoint. Asked everyone whether they wanted to walk or Uber back down and the consensus seemed to be Uber - so we caught one down to the beach. Our driver made the comment "Everyone wants to climb the mountain but no one wants to walk to/from the beach". I would have been offended but I didn't really care about opinions of strangers. Also he was driving a bit erratically. I didn't tip him

// It was a good thing we did Uber down because we arrived at the beach in time for the sunset. It really was a great place to view it and lots of people had their phones out to record it.

// Walked back to our hostel. Lots of walking but it was only a couple of kilometres.

// Next day dad went out to get a really old geocache without us. We did a walk round Ala Moana and the park there. Discovered Magic Island is not actually an island. Stopped by the rocks - Betty enjoyed watching the crabs while Luke enjoyed watching the ocean.

// Didn't do too much. Later went down to the beach in the late afternoon. Water was really warm. Swam part way up the stream and then floated my way back. It's much easier to float in the saltwater than in freshwater Lake Superior.

// Lots of 7-Eleven meals as its nearby and cheap
