// Got up at 7am. This was partly because I checked the wrong phone and thought it was 10am (which it was in Vancouver)

// 7 Eleven breakfast. Also it rained a bit.

// Caught an Uber out to Manoa Falls. It was a lot cheaper than yesterday - less than a US dollar per minute of driving

// Hike to Manoa falls was through a rainforest. Lots of bamboo and other exotic plants. Also lots of water dripping from everything. It rained a bit but that didn't account for all the water dripping and flowing along the path. Waterfall was a bit lacklustre. Also bugs.

// Dad tried to find several geocaches along the path but GPS was giving him trouble.

// The walk wasn't hard but everyone (else) was a bit tired. This was supposed to be a test so it was a bit worrying that it had been so hard. We decided to walk down to a supermarket and then go back to our accommodation. This was 30 minutes of walking in the mostly sun. When we got to the supermarket we had to sit down for a long while before even going inside. Food was expensive

// We decided we really wanted to go to Diamond Head. Dad initially told us to go without him but eventually decided he could come along. Third Uber trip of the day - also cheap.

// We arrived 3:15-ish. We had to reserve a slot and all the morning slots had been taken. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the late hour meant that parts of the path were shaded by the crater wall. Otherwise it would have all been in the sun.

// Dad doing geocache questions along the way. Tunnel then views

// Nice view from the summit out over Waikiki. However I noticed Dad had seemingly given up and sat down 10 steps from the top. It turns out it was a strategic sit so he could fish underneath the step for a geocache.

// While we enjoyed the time at the top, Dad went to check out another viewpoint then started back the way we came. This was odd since it was supposed to be a loop. It turned out we could squeak underneath a part of the structure. We weren't sure whether Dad didn't see it or he decided he didn't want to do it. So we went down and just met up with him down the steps. It turns out it was the "didn't see it"

// Lots of shade on the way down, plus more geocaches

// Walked through a tunnel to a viewpoint. Asked everyone whether they wanted to walk or Uber back down and the consensus seemed to be Uber - so we caught one down to the beach. Our driver made the comment "Everyone wants to climb the mountain but no one wants to walk to/from the beach". I would have been offended but I didn't really care about opinions of strangers. Also he was driving a bit erratically. I didn't tip him

// It was a good thing we did Uber down because we arrived at the beach in time for the sunset. It really was a great place to view it and lots of people had their phones out to record it.

// Walked back to our hostel. Lots of walking but it was only a couple of kilometres.

// Next day dad went out to get a really old geocache without us. We did a walk round Ala Moana and the park there. Discovered Magic Island is not actually an island. Stopped by the rocks - Betty enjoyed watching the crabs while Luke enjoyed watching the ocean.

// Didn't do too much. Later went down to the beach in the late afternoon. Water was really warm. Swam part way up the stream and then floated my way back. It's much easier to float in the saltwater than in freshwater Lake Superior.

// Lots of 7-Eleven meals as its nearby and cheap
