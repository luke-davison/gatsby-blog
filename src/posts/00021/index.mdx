Unfortunately all good things come to an end. And so must our trip to the Queenstown-Lakes district. However it’s a good thing we booked an evening flight – that gave us one more day to spend adventuring.

Today’s adventure is to Glenorchy, the tiny town East of Queenstown, on the way to nowhere.

> Here I am, at nowhere

Today wasn’t the nicest. I think it was overcast for the whole day. Not horrible (could have been another Tuesday) but not great. The lake isn’t at its bluest without the sun.

> Barely blue at all

Anyway, Glenorchy isn’t a big town. It only had two cafes and one was closed, so that narrowed down nicely where we went for breakfast. (Fun fact, it did have a dumpling restaurant but that wasn’t open yet). Afterwards, all we could do was just walk around and take photos.

Glenorchy claims to be home to several Lord of the Rings filming locations – but it doesn’t specify which. They certainly could be, what with all the surroundings but it would be nice to point to a place and a scene and be able to say “found it!”

> An ode to the Wanaka tree we didn’t end up seeing

We started a walk that went… somewhere. I don’t know, we didn’t get very far.

> Nice, but we’ve all seen paths with trees before

While walking I remembered a conversation Betty’s mum had with another patron at the cafe. Apparently they knew each other from the bus from yesterday. The conversation went like this:

Other patron: “Hey, it’s you. Are you heading to Paradise too?”

Betty’s mum, unsure about where the other person was talking about: “Uhh… yes?”

Other patron: “Okay, I guess we’ll see you there.”

Like Betty’s mum, I didn’t know where she was talking about either. So I googled it. It was a small place 20 minutes away. The first result was a blog entry about some sort of walk there. I figured that it sounded a lot nicer than the extremely average walk we were currently doing. Plus, wouldn’t want to make Betty’s mum a liar.

So we drove to Paradise. The road turned to gravel with 7 km but that’s fine – our rental car could handle it. We arrived at Paradise (we could tell by the sign), then before we knew it we had driven through it. All that seemed to be there was farms.

So I checked the blog entry. It was a good thing I still had it open because there was no cellphone coverage here. It said the walk was through a gate with a Chinese sign (which didn’t exist) “that looked like it was someone’s driveway” and up a hill. Well, all the driveways looked like people’s private driveways. Could easily be doing some trespassing here.

So I picked the gate with the most hill and walked up the driveway. It appeared I had picked correctly. But that didn’t mean we weren’t confronted by the property owner on arrival and informed that this was private land.

> Here’s Betty opening the gate on the way out.

But it was the right place. The place was run by a trust and let people walk round but encouraged donations. I put all the coins I had in the donation box ($5 something) and we went exploring.

First thing we noticed was the old Glenorchy school which had been moved here. Looked nice inside. Unfortunately we were too old to enrol.

Then we set off down the path. It could have been autumn for all the leaves on the ground. Betty pointed out that this landscape matched that of the final Uruk-hai battle in The Fellowship of the Ring. She was right – it was a match. I couldn’t have been more pround of here.

> Cue action music

We passed a bunch of other old stuff before coming out into the fields. Cue several photo opportunities.

> This was the last photo I took before I realised exactly how terrible my phone was at the hazy sky. Rest of the photos were with Betty’s.

Even Betty was getting in on the action.

> Can’t beat that smile

Naturally I did too, but with a bit more silliness.

It was a nice place, with all the mountains about. I suspect they’re trying to invent themselves as a wedding venue.

> “How can you tell,” you’re probably asking

It was a nice place. I don’t know whether it is necessary to drive all the way out there but having a variety of things to look at was nice. Betty climbed a tree:

> How old are you again?

Don’t know what happened to that other cafe patron. Guess they didn’t find the hidden place we found. Not sure why else people would come here, unless they like looking at driveways.

On the way out I made everyone get out for a group photo in front of the sign. Gotta make everyone back home jealous of where we are and what better way than a picture of everyone literally standing in “Paradise”.

Also, this is our last day here. Going to be heading back soon. No more hill climbing. Only one small story left to tell.
