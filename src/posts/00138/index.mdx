We’re finally finished with our first leg of our trip.

Time to say goodbye to our car. Since arriving on the 19th, we’ve travelled around 2,800 miles (about 4,500 kilometres). The odometer of the car says its only done 11,000 miles so literally a quarter of that was us.

2,800 miles is about the distance from Los Angeles to New York. It is more than twice the length of Cape Reinga to Bluff (driving SH1).

We’ve travelled in seven different states, stayed in six of them and spotted licence plates of 47 of the 50 states in the USA.

We’ve driven at speeds of 85 miles per hour (about 137 kilometres per hour) legally (it was the speed limit). That’s one way to discourage speeding – make the limit so high that people are terrified to go any faster.

Our car has handled the open roads, gravel parking lots, a dirt road, and one instance where I misread how large a bump in the road was and hit it far too fast. It also handled the Death Valley heat of 108 Fahrenheit. Overall its been a pretty good car.

I should have taken more pictures when we had the chance. They grow up so fast.

> *Sigh* This picture, from Yosemite, was the best picture of the car I took. It’s the white car third from the front, jutting out because apparently I’m not great at judging distances in front of the car.
