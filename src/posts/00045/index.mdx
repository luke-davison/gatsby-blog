After yesterday we were wary about whether we were pushing ourselves into more long hikes. Perhaps we just needed a bit of a rest. Fortunately we’re staying in each location multiple days so there’s no need to try and cram things in. So today was for a few things that weren’t long walks.

So our first stop was a bird park.

They didn’t have much but they did have seven Takahe (above) as well as a couple of Kakas and a bunch Antipodes Island parakeets (below). I don’t know much about the parakeets (didn’t read the signs) but they had a very distinctive call. However neither of us are good at describing bird calls. The closest I can get is that sometimes our rental car makes squeaking sounds when driving down bumpy roads – and the parakeets sounded pretty much like that.

Watching birds wasn’t the only fun that was to be had at the bird park:

After we had gone round the park it was still very early. Now what? I’d seen that there was a viewpoint out in the country so we went there.

Was little more than a carpark on a hill but that was fine – at least the road wasn’t gravel. Got a good look at how small Te Anau is. If the picture doesn’t show how small it is, know that the town has exactly one fast food franchise store. So not the smallest, but certainly not large either.

So, we’ve now done two activities and we’ve spent barely any time at all. Betty pipes up that the river to the south of the town is apparently a Lord of the Rings filming location. We know it won’t be a great tourist attraction because, well, otherwise it would be known as a great tourist attraction.

So we headed to Rainbow Reach (this time gravel road grrrr). There was a very swingy bridge across the river that apparently was used in The Fellowship of the Ring:

The bridge took us to the Keppler Track. So we figured we’d walk along it for a bit.

And writing this I’m really annoyed. The track and the forest was really really nice but the niceness doesn’t come across in the photos we’d taken.

The trees were mostly all beech, which covered the forest floor with a nice layer of tiny little leaves. The track was very wide, very smooth, and very flat – a nice change for us. The forest floor that wasn’t track was usually ferns.

It was apparently the river that featured in Lord of the Rings but it was this forest that felt like something from that trilogy. It just felt like somewhere that Lothlorein or Rivendell elves would make their home.

Anyway, it wasn’t just trees. There was this wetland:

It wasn’t all that interesting but it was a nice change. At this point we asked ourselves whether we wanted to walk the hour back to the car, or whether we wanted to walk two hours back to the car (by continuing another half hour along).

We ended up at a lake.

And then we headed back.

I don’t know much about the Great Walks but I had wondered whether the Keppler track was worthy of its place in the list. I think it’s the only one that ends up back where it started. Sure, that makes it much easier logistically but do you lose some of the satisfaction by not having travelled somewhere? Regardless of the answer to that pointless question, I have to say that if the rest of the track is half as well maintained as this section then it certainly is worthy of inclusion.

So that was how we spent a day (well, part of a day) walking after deciding not to do much walking.
