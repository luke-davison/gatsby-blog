Okay, we’re in Dunedin now. Firstly, it’s cold. I think we’ve had electric blankets at every accommodation so far but this was the first time we’ve used one. In summer. Well, Betty did. Luke doesn’t mind the cold so much – but even he agrees this is a bit cold.

Also, the streets are a mess. There’s something about the layout of the roads which makes Google Maps really struggle to give sufficient directions. More than once already we’ve taken the wrong turn due to either the intersections being too close together and the instructions haven’t kept up, or because Google would sometimes invent intersections.

But anyway – we didn’t come here just to complain about a city many people happily (probably) live in. What walks do you have for us Dunedin?

The first walk we found was to a rock formation called the “Organ Pipes”. After walking up some very muddy steps we got to a sign pointing us towards this:

> …did they break?

The path just kind of led up to the big pile of geometric rocks and then stopped. Or did it? The actual organ pipes appeared to be above us. It looked like there a kind of trail of rocks up to the right so we followed it. We eventually found some sort of path which led out to the top of the organ pipe structure.

This structure was quite interesting. It appeared to be a whole bunch of hexagonal, pentagonal, and square pillars made of rock. When viewed from some angles these pillars resemble a pipe organ. As you can tell from the previous photo, you can’t really see the resemblance from above.

Once we had made our way back down the pile of rocks we noticed some concrete foundations mixed among the pile. It looked like there might have been a viewing structure here at one time. But now it was just a trail to nothing.

We had the option to continue on to the summit of the hill but the weather wasn’t feeling all that nice. It was supposed to be an okay day but it was windy and the sky was as overcast as it could be without raining. Instead we just headed back down to our car and drove on to a town called Port Chalmers to see if they had anything tasty to eat.

While it was a town, Port Chalmers turned out to be a port.

> Who would have guessed?

So not a touristy town. Instead this was a town built to service the giant port which presently had two container ships being unloaded or loaded. Fortunately there was some fun to be had on the hill we found ourselves on:

> I guess this is here for the port workers too

Once fed we still didn’t feel like returning to our morning activity of hiking so we visited the botanical gardens. While large and certainly impressive, the gardens weren’t always visually appealing.

However there was a bunch of aviaries in the park.

Most cages held a number of varieties of birds. Some loud, some colourful, some hiding. All stuff we’d seen before.

The last enclosure apparently held South Island Kakas – the third enclosure like this. We noticed a rhythmic banging noise coming from inside. When we looked in, we noticed the Kaka was on the keeper’s service door and was attacking the padlock repeatedly.

He clearly wanted out.

However after 30 seconds he noticed us and came bouncing over to say, “Hi”.

> Or to say, “Let me out”

They certainly are clever birds. I wonder if it wanted to be petted, but with a beak like that I wasn’t going to attempt it. After several minutes we noticed that this Kaka wasn’t alone in its enclosure. Clearly the other Kaka was worried we might be flirting with its partner so it flew over to make it clear whose partner he/she was. And what better way to do that than by making out with each other in front of us.

> Maybe it was wrong to photograph this

We took that as our cue to leave.

So this was our first day in Dunedin. It had rained overnight but it didn’t feel like the day had gotten over that until the afternoon. We’ll just have to hope tomorrow is better.
