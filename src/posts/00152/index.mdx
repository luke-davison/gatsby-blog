Okay, last day in Vancouver - how best to make the most of it?  Well, mostly laundry and shopping to get things ready for the next phase of our holiday.  Very mundane stuff that I can't really blog about without boring myself.  But after that I convinced Betty we should try a walk.  But this wasn't just any walk...

The Grouse Grind is a famous hike in Vancouver.  It is well known to have 2,830 steps.  This is twice as many steps at the Hakarimata Summit hike that Hamiltonians love testing themselves on.  Clearly Vancouverians love pushing themselves even more if this is their idea of a fun challenge.

Except the Grouse Grind is currently closed.  No date for when it will re-open.  So we can't do that.  Instead people recommend the "BCMC" trail which starts at the same place that the Grouse Grind starts and finishes... at the same place the the Grouse Grind finish.  But this is a different trail?  Well if the Grind is so very popular, we figured we should at least get a taste of it by doing the BCMC trail instead.

We presume the difference between the BCMC trail and the Grouse Grind is that the Grind is a better made track.  BCMC has very clear markers but sometimes the track is little more than rocks.  Grouse Grind is known for its steps while the BCMC doesn't have many official steps.  However they both cover the same height so it's still basically the same, right?

Well, we can confirm that it was hard.  Basically the whole track was just an uphill climb in the forest.  And it certainly challenged us.  Interestingly there was helpful markers tracking the length of the trail which was helpful to tell us exactly how badly and slowly we were going.

> We took our first break / mini-break less than 10% of the way up

There was a rare breeze but otherwise it was quite hot.  But at least it was shaded.  People were coming back down reporting that they didn't make it to the top.  That got us wondering - could we even make it.

> Such a handy place for a stump seat

Eventually we got to the halfway point.  After reading some of the comments online from people who had done it recently I knew to look out for something in the second half of the trail.  But nothing changed initially.  The track got a bit wetter, but that was about it.  The forest still looked the same.  Then we came across this:

On the sides of the trail there were patches of snow.  This was a welcome relief in some regards - they were like a guaranteed breeze, radiating off cold air.  The breeze had disappeared so we had been quite hot.

But as we ascended further, the patches of snow became bigger, to the point where the track was getting quite obscured.

Then, eventually there just stopped being dirt and everything was snow.

The sign at the bottom of the hill recommended microspikes, which are things you add to your shoes to help walk on ice and frozen snow.  But we didn't have those.  People online had noted that it was do-able without microspikes, which really made it sound like there'd be less snow walking than there was.  Altogether it probably covered 30% of the whole trail.

As you may know, ice is slippery.  The last thing we want to do is fall over and badly hurt ourselves.  So we took it slow.  Fortunately this is still a heavily trafficked trail and so the countless people before us had already stamped out a route which usually included clear places to step.  But sometimes there were large holes, showing exactly how far we were above the dirt - and therefore how far we could sink if the snow gave way.

> Luke fears not

But surprisingly, overall this was a rather fun experience.  It was like walking in a winter wonderland but without all the cold.  We were always careful and not once did we slip or fall.  And we weren't tired anymore, likely because we were now taking our time rather than racing to get the climb over and done with.  And it didn't matter that we were taking our time, because we were really enjoying the novelty of our surroundings.

Now, one would note that we still need to come down.  Going up a slippery hill is probably a lot less dangerous than going down.  Well, not to worry - at the top there is a gondola.

> I'm always saying more trails should have gondolas

This is actually the default way to get back down.  It does cost some money, but less than half of a return trip ticket - so that's nice.  Also at the top was a "chalet" complete with a surprisingly reasonably priced coffee bar (not that we were in the mood for coffee) and some other touristy stuff.

> Well technically I didn't, but I basically did

The view was decent, though the mountain was angled a bit in the wrong direction to get a view out of the whole of Vancouver.

> Stupid mountain not facing directly South

So we took our "Hooray, we did it!" photo

And then started wondering, "Is there anything else up here?"

Walking out the back of the chalet we noticed this sign, pointing out into the snowy landscape.

![Image](PXL_20230503_235650472.jpg)

The conundrum was whether this sign meant, "Grizzly bear - stay away" or "Grizzly bear - come see".  We hoped it was the latter and set off.

Perhaps ten minutes later we came across an electrified enclosure.  There was a sign saying that there were two grizzly bears, but they were both just coming out of hibernation.  Of course, snow was everywhere still so I can't blame them for wanting to stay in their den.  We could only really stare inside through a small opening, with most of the den not visible.

Fortunately one of the bears was doing some digging or something in the small part we could see.

> Still looked a bit sleepy

They truly are amazing creatures.  So furry, and so much like a teddy bear - but with undeniable deadliness coupled with clearly high intelligence for a non-human animal.  While I knew to expect some snow, and a gondola - the bear enclosure was a complete surprise to me.  And let's not forget, this was all essentially free.  We hadn't paid anything or committed to paying anything yet.  And if we walked back down again we would have had this entire day free of charge.

> And all the free snowballs one can throw

But of course it was much safer to gondola our way back down.  So we bought a couple of one-way tickets and enjoyed the views over Vancouver as we came back down.

> Actually we didn't enjoy them that much - some of the other passengers were being really annoying

So, that was how we spent our last day in Vancouver.  It will almost certainly be one of the highlights of our entire trip (hopefully one of many).  It has shown us that snow hiking can be really enjoyable.  Likely this is not the last we will see of snow on the tracks as many parks report snow on tracks until July.  But as long as there is no avalanche risks (which was the reason why the Grouse Grind wasn't do-able) then some snow is not something we should avoid.

I'd definitely be keen to invest in some microspikes or snowshoes to do more like this in the future - it just would have felt stupid buying them right now with us heading into summer.

With our time in Vancouver wrapped up, it will now be time to see what the USA holds for us.  Again, we're heading down there because too many trails in Canada would be closed due to avalanche risks right now, so we'll spend a month in the land of stars and stripes while the country defrosts.

That is if we can cross the border...
