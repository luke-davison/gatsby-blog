Okay, I’m back. I know it was mean of me to end the last blog post with such a cliffhanger. “How can you be both at home and still be on holiday?” you’re probably shouting at your screen. The answer is simple:

We planned two holidays.

Originally there was only going to be one. As mentioned earlier, we hadn’t had a break from work in a while and we couldn’t wait until Christmas. So we started planning. We even booked all our accommodation. Then I found out I was resigning. Fortunately our holiday could proceed as planned. But we knew my leave balance would be reduced to zero when I switched jobs. Therefore, we had better make the most of the gap between jobs.

The Queenstown holiday was the extra holiday we added on. So what I’m saying is, we haven’t even gotten to the main holiday yet. The five days we spent in the South Island were just the entree – now it’s the main course.

Well, I say that. But I am deeply worried that the entree is going to completely dominate the main dish. Our plan is to travel round the North Island and go to places we haven’t been before and can’t usually get to for a weekend away. These places aren’t necessarily the most touristy. I don’t know how these places will compare with our adventures already, in the most touristy part of New Zealand.

But we’re going anyway. But first, some chores…

Had to mow the lawns. Couldn’t let them getting too wild. Also had to do some repacking. Also did some laundry, taking with us some wet items that we would need.

Today we were driving to Lake Waikaremoana. It is inside Te Uruwera, a former National Park and a place I knew very little about. So around noon we headed off to find out.

We spent a bit of time in Rotorua resupplying. We also tried to find the rumoured Butter Chicken flavoured gelato but like our previous two visits, it was not there.

It was about 3 pm when we headed off. Google Maps predicted about a 2.5 hour drive. Some of that was going to be on gravel road, but that’s okay as we knew that already. What I didn’t know was how miserable it would be.

I think I saw a sign that said more than 70 km was unsealed. That doesn’t seem too bad, until you take into account the speed we were travelling. Due to all the corners and the uneven surface, we were probably only averaging 30 km/h. It must have taken us at least an hour longer than what Google Maps had predicted. And it was not pleasant.

We were no longer in our 2019 model 4×4 rental car. Instead we were in our own front wheel drive hatchback. Was our car even going to survive? We hadn’t had a cellphone signal in hours, plus the road was mostly untrafficked. Fortunately we arrived with no problems (other than later than expected), but our car did pay the price with dust all over..

We did get to see a whole bunch of animals, many of them basically roaming free on the side of the road.

Also, trees. There was lots of trees.

We arrived at the holiday park where we’d be staying the night. Unfortunately we’d booked basic accommodation – a far cry from what we’d become used to over the last week.

Not complaining, we knew what we’d booked. Certainly saved some money doing so. But today certainly felt like a shock to the system after the five days just been.

Fortunately the road out would be a lot shorter. But today did make me question whether we needed to come here. We’d have to wait until tomorrow to find out.
