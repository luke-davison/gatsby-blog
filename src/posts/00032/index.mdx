“Isthmus”.

Is it legal to have that many consonants in a row in the middle of a word?

When discussing it with Betty I would usually just blurt out something like “Ishmish”. Unfortunately when we were leaving our Airbnb this morning our host asked what our plans were. For a second I was terrified. How do I say it without looking like an idiot. I responded with something along the line of “Isths-miss” and got a nod in response – hopefully because he understood and not because he had no idea what I just said and was too polite to ask a second time.

We found out later the answer – the “th” is silent.

Isthmus Peak is the great “alternative” to Roy’s Peak. The latter can get so busy that people have to go elsewhere and this track ticks a lot of the same boxes. The length is similar – over five hours return. The height is similar – over a kilometre in elevation to gain. And all the walking up a hill in the sun you could ever want.

Luke started the trip by not screwing his water bottle properly and it completely emptied into the car boot on the drive. Fortunately he always packs more water than he needs. It did mean that his bag started the walk soaked. Usually it gets to stay dry for at least a few minutes until he starts sweating – which doesn’t take very long if we’re walking uphill (which is basically every day).

This track was a bit more varied than Roy’s Peak. It was sometimes a farm track, sometimes a goat track. It was sometimes flat, and even sometimes it went down (before going back up again). There was even the occasional moment of shade.

But there was still a lot of climbing.

It also had the same issue that the other Wanaka hikes have had. It’s not ideal having to share the trail with the locals because, well, the next picture probably gives you an idea of what I mean:

At least we had views to look at (if we dare look up from where we’re stepping). Like the Roy’s Peak hike we had a pleasingly blue lake to look at while hiking up – this time Lake Hawea.

It was also nice that it was cloudy today (makes for easier walking). Perhaps too cloudy. The clouds were supposed to clear by the afternoon and we were hoping they would so that we would get more scenic views.

And you know what, they did.

It was basically the perfect weather. A curtain of clouds while we do the hard part. Blue skies for the viewing and the return downhill.

> “Why are we not there yet?”

It’s interesting how there’s a certain line of elevation (probably about 1,200 metres above sea level) where ordinary plants stop growing and we get the alpine stuff (which are presumably inedible because there was no evidence of locals up here). I guess this is probably where the snowfall hits hardest during winter.

At the top of the mountain range we were treated to views of Lake Wanaka and a number of snowy mountains in the distance.

Funnily enough the clouds never fully went away. Lines of clouds remained around the tops of each mountain range – not unlike how snow would if we’d been here many months earlier (or later).

We can confirm that this trail is definitely not as popular as Roy’s Peak. I think we only saw three people in the three hours we took to get to the top (it’s a longer walk okay – so what if it took us a while). And it was really nice to be able to sit at the peak by ourselves, enjoying the mountain air free from the reminder that we share this world with seven billion other people. We stuck around for quite a while.

We also get quite shy and won’t try the silly poses when there’s other people around to see.

> First try again

I also must admit I do see why this trail is not as popular as Roy’s Peak. There’s just something about the views which don’t feel as epic. I think it actually is the signs of civilization that make Roy’s Peak that much better. There we stare down at roads, fields, boats, and the township of Wanaka itself. Mount Aspiring is also much closer.

For Isthmus Peak, while walking up we just get Lake Hawea and the mountains behind which, while definitely pleasing to look at, are a lot more featureless. At the top we’re treated to a much wider field of view, but the real snowy mountains all seem like they’re behind other ranges. And the trail is a bit longer while the peak a bit shorter – so Roy’s Peak certainly feels the more epic.

However if one day Roy’s Peak starts filling up its parking lot again, then I certainly would see the appeal of coming here instead. For now it will just be for those who have done Roy’s Peak and want more.

…but what do we do if we’ve done Roy’s Peak and Isthmus Peak and want more?
