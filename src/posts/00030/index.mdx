On our penultimate day on holiday we decided we’d head to Glenorchy to walk some of the northern end of the Routeburn trail. It’s one of the ten New Zealand Great Walks and while it usually takes three days to hike, we had heard some nice things about doing just part of it as a day trip.

The question became, how much of it do we do?

Option 1 – walk to the Routeburn Flats hut and back. It would be about 15 kilometres return and would be mostly in forest with some uphill.

Option 2 – walk to the Routeburn Falls hut and back. It would be about 19 kilometres return and the extra distance would involve a fair amount of elevation change as it climbs up to more mountainous terrain.

Option 3 – walk to Lake Harris and back. This would be about 25 kilometres return and realistically probably wasn’t even an option for us. We’ve never walked that far before in one day – never mind the elevation we’d have to climb.

We started reasonably early. As I said the track started through a forest.

In many ways the trail was like the Keppler track. Very well made and winding through scenic bush. Occasionally there’d be a swing bridge over a stream – or where a stream sometimes is. One thing very nice about the track is just how easy it is to walk. No stepping over routes, no awkwardly large steps to step. And since it was relatively people-free we could just walk along, side by side, rather quickly.

Before we knew it we were at the first waterfall – Bridal Veil Falls. This would have to be the least original name for a waterfall ever. There are other things that look like falling water guys. How about… okay I guess it’s hard to come up with waterfall names.

Also, I didn’t actually realise there was a waterfall here. Betty took a picture of me but I thought it was just with a stream. I think the waterfall was below me, which was where the stream flowed into a kind of slot canyon. Again, this late in summer is not prime waterfall season. But still, I can’t imagine this falls looking much like a bridal veil.

> Maybe it was discovered by a Mr Bridal Veil.

At this point we also started to pass groups of people going in the other direction. And these people apparently liked to hike with name badges pinned to their shirts. Looks like we’ve found the guided tours.

![Image](img_20220304_103651.jpg)

Very soon we were at the fields we’d seen in photographs. We were arriving at Routeburns Flats – a big open stretch of field surrounded by mountains. Very scenic. And this was the first time we decided to stop for a water break.

We were almost at the turnaround point for option 1 – the Routeburn Flats hut. It was still mid morning. Guess that means we’ll be doing option 2 then. We can handle a bit of walking up a hill, especially if the trail is easy to walk on as it has been up until this point.

![Image](img_20220304_103111.jpg)

This was also the point we met a robin who clearly didn’t understand the meaning of the word “danger”. It just hopped around right by our feet, before hopping up and inspecting my bag. Just doing its job perhaps? – making sure we’re not bringing any contraband into the forest.

We didn’t bother going to the first hut. It was five minutes out of our way. We’ll swing by on the way back if we feel like it. Right now we had a hill to climb.

I suspected the nice path might get a bit less nice going uphill. We did a small section of the Routeburn track from the other end when we were staying in Te Anau and it wasn’t exactly smooth walking. But counter to my expectations the path stayed the same.

After about 45 minutes we noticed something in the trees ahead of us. Legs – dozens of them. Not human legs of course, they were much too long for that. Building legs. We’d reached the next hut.

![Image](img_20220304_113750.jpg)

Routeburn Flats hut is actually quite amazing. As mentioned it sits high above the forest floor on giant wooden legs (what are they supposed to be called?). This means that you can stand on the balcony of the hut and look out over the trees into the valley below. Right now the hut was empty, with the previous groups having departed and the next groups having not arrived. Betty took the opportunity to use their bathrooms and found that they flushed – a rarity on any walk.

Perhaps at this point I’ll also mention that we weren’t quite alone on our walk either. Soon after we started we’d spotted a couple coming up behind us on the same path. They were clearly walking faster than us but must have been taking more pictures than us for they never fully caught up – until now.

With only one backpack (pink with a picture of a unicorn on it – apparently was all they had) between the two of them, they were here for the same reasons as us. We both sat outside the hut and commented how quick it took to get here. Then we all asked each other, “should we go on?”

We were now at the turnaround point for the option 2 that I mentioned at the start of this blog post. We’d come about 9.5 kilometres and so we had 9.5 kilometres to walk back – fortunately almost all downhill. But we’d only just arrived at alpine height. Once we turn around we’re back down into a mostly view-less forest.

…should we continue on?

We all said to ourselves, “May as well”. And after not five minutes of walking it was clear we made the right decision. As we climbed the first hill we looked down at a view much nicer than what we could see from the hut.

![Image](img_20220304_115246.jpg)

And that decision was further confirmed as we came over a rise and entered true alpine terrain that we’ve seen (and enjoyed) so much of on this trip.

![Image](img_20220304_120924.jpg)

The unicorn couple had set off first and speedily vanished so it was just us again to enjoy the surroundings – free to make all the silly poses that we wanted.

![Image](img_20220304_121752.jpg)

But it wasn’t easy going here. We were no longer walking on a wide, graveled path. There were a lot of weird steps and odd corners as the trail struggled with the now different terrain. It did mean we had a lot more opportunities to stop and embarrass Betty by taking pictures of her when she was not ready.

![Image](img_20220304_122136.jpg)

We’d read about the Harris Lake prior to starting this hike so we figured we’d walk until we found it. The sign estimated the length of time to the Harris Saddle (presumably near the Harris Lake) to be two hours. We eventually found the lake though the track didn’t go anywhere near it.

![Image](img_20220304_124933.jpg)

There wasn’t an obvious place to stop and enjoy the area. We were now kind of up on a ledge looking down on the lake. This wasn’t really a good place for lunch. Maybe once upon the time the trail went past the lake but no longer.

What was option 3 again? Was it to the Harris Lake or to Harris Saddle? Had we already bitten off more than we can chew and our legs would die on the way back? We seemed pretty comfortable. Plus we hadn’t yet caught up to the unicorn couple. We decided to see what was round the corner…

![Image](img_20220304_125442.jpg)

Wouldn’t you know it, we found the saddle. Well, it wasn’t hard to find. After all there’s only one track and so as long as we stuck to it we would have found it eventually. At first it was just some tarns and some hints of mountains beyond. Then we crossed the highest point and we saw the shelter.

![Image](img_20220304_144244.jpg)

So I learned that a shelter is like a hut but without, well, everything. Just a building to help escape from the weather I guess. Right now it was actually surrounded by people – clearly another guided walk group taking a break.

It actually felt a little weird being near them. They have large packs, heavy boots, poles, and are as far away from a town as they’re going to get on their three day hike. Whereas here we were, dressed like we’re out for a stroll in our shorts and sneakers.

We’ve made it further than we were expecting. We honestly didn’t consider Harris Saddle feasible when we set off today. Maybe in the back of our minds we hoped it might be, especially given that we’re at peak fitness right now. Well, we’re congratulating ourselves on walking so far – we still need to walk all the way back.

It will be a 25 kilometre round trip. We’ve walked for four hours and if we tire on the way back likely it will be another four hours back. Our longest walk ever.

…so why do we feel like we want to continue on a little further?

![Image](img_20220304_130620.jpg)

We decided we’d just head down the hill a little. You know, to see what we could find. We did find a better spot to take pictures of the mountains.

![Image](img_20220304_130812.jpg)

And while we’re standing there a group passed us in the other direction. We asked them, “is there anything nearby?” Was there anything to justify walking a bit further along this marvelous track?

There was not. Downhill for four hours. Any views likely won’t be as spectacular as the saddle.

Okay, I guess we’re turning around.

So we’re sitting at the shelter eating lunch when Betty asks, “What if we just walked the whole thing? It’s only 33 kilometres – we’re basically half way there already.”

I replied that it was not a possibility we could consider. While we probably could make it there on foot, we’d finish in the early night in a valley with no cellphone coverage, a full hour by car away from the nearest town – without a car. And even if we could get a ride to Te Anau, we’d still be 171 kilometres from Queenstown. And even if we could get to Queenstown, it was another full hour to get back to where we left our rental car. Sure we had nothing planned for tomorrow, but this would not have worked.

Betty didn’t like this answer. “Okay,” she replied after a while. “What about that?” And then she pointed to the big hill nearby.

The big hill was Conical Hill. It rose as high as Roy’s Peak, some 300 metres above where we were sitting. It had a track to the top, but this was a side trip for people doing the three day hike. This was why the guided group had gathered at the shelter – so some could go up.

Today would already be our longest hike ever and Betty wanted to add on more. And the “more” she wanted to add on was really steep. It was like she had gone crazy in the high altitude. However, I knew something that she didn’t.

I had also gone crazy.

![Image](img_20220304_133138.jpg)

This part was steep. We had long lost the gentle well defined paths at the start of the track. Now we had steep staircases. After that we didn’t even have those any more and we had to climb up rocks.

We’d also lost the unicorn couple. They’d taken the sane approach and turned back.

![Image](img_20220304_133735.jpg)

But I could see why we were doing this. Every metre of elevation gained just improved the view we could see.

![Image](img_20220304_134439.jpg)

And every metre of elevation we gained was an extra accomplishment. Today would clearly be the pinnacle and highest highlight of this holiday.

![Image](img_20220304_140120.jpg)

Despite having walked for four and a half hours, we passed other people ascending. We are no longer Luke and Betty, board gamers. We are Luke and Betty, hiking elite. (and also still board gamers).

![Image](img_20220304_135249.jpg)

We had made it to the top. We had finally found a view spectacular enough to satisfy our appetite for adventure today. We looked out over the snowy mountains and what we are pretty sure was Milford Sound and basked in what we had achieved.

![Image](img_20220304_141102.jpg)

I am really happy the pictures for this hike have come out so well because it really was beautiful.

![Image](img_20220304_141037.jpg)

Who would have thought, the “Great Walks” of New Zealand are pretty great. This is especially true if you can hike without heavy backpacks, like Betty and I did.

It really gave us an experience like our visit to Whistler Mountain in Canada where somehow we managed to saved the best to last. While hiking a previous trail we were ranking some of our best hikes on this trip and ever. It’s still early so we don’t know for sure where this hike will sit, but it may take the number one spot.

Mind you, I seem to have jumped ahead of myself. At this point in the story we appear to be still at the half way point of the hike.

Well, there’s actually not too much more to the story. It was now 2pm. We’d been walking for five hours. While it was downhill, if our legs or bodies got too tired it could take another five hours to get down. We’d finish in daylight, but we wouldn’t have too much to spare.

So we set a steady pace on the way down. We didn’t waste too much time stopping to take photos. After all, we’d seen the views on the way up. We ended up keeping our steady pace all the way down and we made it back to our car with plenty of hours of daylight to spare.

But while we walked back down I made sure to take as many photos as I could. The next group of photos will be a sequence of photos showing the descent. I don’t know if this is going to be interesting to anyone else but I’m sure it’ll help me remember how the walk went and how I felt. Hopefully others will find it interesting too.

(Also sorry Betty, because you usually walk in front of me you’re going to be in all these photos. Couldn’t be helped. Just scroll to the end, there’s some of me there.)

![Image](img_20220304_174814.jpg)

So that was the Routeburn Track. We spent about 8 hours, 45 minutes to walk about 27.5 kilometres. Not sure exactly how much the elevation gain was – possibly about 1,000 to 1,200.

![Image](img_20220304_175009.jpg)

We still have one more day to go but nothing we do tomorrow will beat this. Well, after walking so much likely we won’t be able to do anything tomorrow.

And lastly, as a reward for Betty for having to see so many pictures of herself to get this far, here’s a couple of me trying the jump shot – with only partial success – because I know you love those.
