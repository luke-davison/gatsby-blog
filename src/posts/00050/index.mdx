February 14. An important day – according to “people”. I suppose we’re people too. Today was an important day for our time in Queenstown too – because according to the weather forecast today would be the best weather we’d be getting.

Perhaps the highest rated hike we hadn’t yet done was the Ben Lomond summit. However I wasn’t sure when we’d get round to doing it. Sure, we could do this hike on any day but some days would certainly be better than others. For example, since arriving two days ago we hadn’t yet seen the summit.

But today we woke to clear blue skies. After building our confidence over the last couple of days in the amount of hiking we could handle, we decided to attempt it.

Ben Lomond towers above Queenstown with a peak 1,748 metres above sea level. The city is only at 310 metres above sea level. That’s a whole 1,436 metres we have to climb. If only there was another way.

So after skipping the first 450 metres (and taking a quick snap on the gondola viewing deck) we set off. Still have almost a kilometre of elevation to gain.

Basically the whole hike is through alpine grasses and shrubs – so not a lot of escape from the heat of the sun. Was it a good thing we picked the day with the most sun? We also hadn’t started particularly early, because we had to wait for the gondola to open at 10 am.

As we got higher we were treated to views over Queenstown and Lake Wakitipu.

A bit unusual but our target turn-around point was always within view. That can be a bit demoralising if it takes ages to reach it, but the Ben Lomond track isn’t actually too long. (Especially if you skip the first hour).

But first we had to climb up to the Lomond Saddle. Once at the saddle we were of course required to stop and take a picture with the Southern Alps.

> Requirement satisfied

The next part of of the track was a bit steeper, climbing up the ridge to the top.

Lots of rest stops were had on the way up this section.

I think we took the full hour to get up this section. That wasn’t a surprise – no one was saying it would be quicker. But that still left plenty of time to enjoy the views.

Way back down wasn’t as knee ruining as we were expecting – so that was nice.

Some breaks were still had of course. Arm pits needed airing.

And some more photo opportunities. Don’t have too much more to say at this point but still have some photos to get through. Maybe things happened but I was too tired to remember them.

No sweaty face photos sorry. Only sweaty back photos.

And so that’s it. We’ve now done the highest walk we were intending for this holiday. But the only reason we did this was so we could justify going out somewhere nice for dinner. It is February 14 after all.

(Unfortunately the first three restaurants we tried were closed. We ended up at a taco stand down a back alley. I say that like it’s a bad thing but it’s somehow part of its appeal. Tacos must have been good because we went back the next day).
