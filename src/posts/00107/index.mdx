Our accommodation tonight is in a place called “Half Dome Village” which consists of hundreds of tents in a camping ground like setting. Except these tents are held up by wooden A-frame structures. And they have their own beds with fresh towels and sheets. Also, electricity. Ours even has a rather large electric heater.

It’s still quite far from “glamping” (glamorous camping). Everything is just a bit run down. I can’t blame them though. Apparently the extra strength winter caused heavy damage to the camp. I only received the confirmation email a week before we flew here that the place was back at full capacity.

We’re also required to keep all food and smelly things (toothpaste, deodorent) in a locker outside our tent. This is to discourage bears who we all know, can’t read the instructions to open the lockers in the dark.
