When we were in Queenstown in 2020 we didn’t stay very long – only about three days. However during that time we did manage to fit in a couple of half day hikes. One was up Queenstown hill and it was perfectly nice and scenic. The other was a trail we just happened to drive by. It took much longer than we were anticipating, allowed us no shade from the afternoon sun, and yet somehow was the highlight of our trip.

Returning to Queenstown today along the Crown Range road we decided to revisit that walk.

Rock Peak claims it is a 1 hour hike. Really it is closer to 1.5. The start is certainly not easy as it winds up the side of a hill. But there is one thing that makes this quite a nice walk – it doesn’t start at the bottom of the hill.

The Crown Range road is one of New Zealand’s highest roads and the walk starts at the highest part – 1,000 metres in elevation – so right from the start of the walk we’re in alpine terrain. The summit is actually higher than Isthmus Peak and not too far off Roy’s Peak. Not bad for such a short walk.

And like Roy’s Peak, we aren’t all that far from signs of civilization. At regular intervals during the walk we are able to gaze down at fields and houses. We can see cars and trucks driving along state highway 6 – we can even hear them when they’re loud enough.

And yet being up here still feels like we’re alone.

This is certainly not an unknown walk. It starts from the most scenic viewpoint on the road which links Queenstown and Wanaka – so you’d think it would be well travelled. But in both times we’ve been I think we’ve only crossed paths with three people.

In our opinion, this is still top of the list of must-do walks in Queenstown – as long as you don’t mind a bill of hill climbing.

We got to the top in a blistering 1 hour and 10 minutes (much faster than last time) which unfortunately just left us wanting more. The trail actually does go further – it runs along the mountain range. We decided to follow it for a while but alas, it ran too far. We could follow this trail for six hours and we’d have a lovely time, but then we’d be six hours away from our car. And we probably don’t have any spare days on this trip to try and make it work – which is a shame.

I get the feeling I just started another list: “Walks we’ll do next time we’re on holiday in Queenstown”.

With the walk not being very long it meant that we got to Queenstown right on time for lunch. But lunchtime is too early to relax. So we picked another walk to do – Bob’s Cove. It’s known for being short and easy. In fact, the walk can be over in well under an hour. It runs through a forest down to a bay / cove. And on a sunny day like today I can see why people like hanging out here.

We forget sometimes, when we’re up in the mountains, that there is a lot of beauty to be had around the waters. Like Rock Peak, we needed more from this walk so we just continued on round the edge of the lake. It led up a small hill to a view point which turned out to be surprisingly hot in the afternoon sun.

> Surprising hot

You know, technically it is supposed to be autumn now. Plus we really didn’t get that hot on the rock peak walk. I guess this is what we have to deal with when we’re down nearer to sea level. I really hope we haven’t acclimatised to Queenstown’s weather and we’ll find ourselves overwhelmed with the Waikato heat when we return.

> …if we return

Two more days left. The countdown is getting awfully close to zero now. Once upon a time it was twenty-something days and it felt like we’d be on holiday forever. And yet it doesn’t feel like we’re done here.

We’ll just have to take that as a sign this has been a great holiday.
