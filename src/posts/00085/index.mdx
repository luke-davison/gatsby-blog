When we go somewhere, often we’ll google “Free things to do in ….” If you’re on holiday, chances are you’ll enjoy any activity so why pay money when you can do free stuff?

After visiting the New York Public Library (also free, yah!) we walked halfway across the island (isn’t that impressive, it’s a very thin island) to the Highline.

This is a former rail line that is two stories above the street. Twenty years or so it was developed into a walkway with a large number of plants being planted on it. Our day one guide recommended not doing it in the afternoon because of the heat.

We figured because it was cloudy it would be okay.

> Fun fact: the shores of Manhattan are lined with industrial buildings because historical New Yorkers doubted anyone would want to live there.

The Highline was nice, but not that impressive. The plants and flowers weren’t that impressive. The views were often obscured by buildings. Overall it was fine but unlike the library, I wouldn’t say its a must-see in New York.

The next day we took the hop-on hop-off bus back downtown. We’d been prevented from getting there the previous day due to a parade to celebrate the USA women’s soccer team winning the football world cup.

Another frequently recommended free activity was to walk along the Brooklyn Bridge. This bridge was the longest of its kind in 1856 when it was built – a full 50% longer than the next longest bridge. The steel frame had to be disguised inside stone pillars as stone was (wrongly) more trusted by the general public.

> See those towers – just a facade to hide the steel structure.

We thought it was quite a nice walk. Like the Highline it was quite crowded but at least this time there were lanes for pedestrians.

If I’m recommending things to do in New York, I’d add this to the list. It’s a decent walk, you get a good view of the city and you get to experience some of New York’s history.
