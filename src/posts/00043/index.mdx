This was our third day in Te Anau and we’d had one day of cloud and one full day of rain. Fortunately the weather was forecasting two sunny days to end our time in the area. Today would be the sunniest.

We decided to come to Te Anau because of it’s proximity to Fiordland. However when you have a rental car and you only want to drive places, Fiordland isn’t really much more than the Milford Sound road. That being said there is a fair amount to walk in that area. Three walks stood out to us.

Three walks divided by two days equals greater than one walk per day.

I’m glad I still remember some things from high school.

Today we’d be tackling the two shorter walks. The first was part of the Routeburn track and led up a hill to a summit called Key Summit. There wasn’t really too much to the walk. From the carpark it ascends consistently through the forest until a junction, after which it climbs into alpine terrain.

Before we knew it we were at the peak. Supposedly this walk was a three hour trip, here and back, but we got here relatively quickly.

At the top was a small loop round some tarns with some handy info which I have now completely forgotten.

> Info: mountains look good in reflections

Overall the peak was a bit underwhelming. It wasn’t all that high and it also wasn’t all that viewy. I think it was due to how wide and round the top of the peak was. There was no way to get a good view back down into the valleys, nor was there a way to see in all directions.

It was an easy enough walk so I wouldn’t not recommend it but it didn’t compare to some other viewpoints we’d seen.

Having not got up all that early and having already driven an hour from Te Anau, it was lunchtime. So we made our way through the tunnel to Milford Sound at the end of the road. We knew there was one or two eateries there, which was more than the zero eateries anywhere nearby.

Through the tunnel and at the end of the road we parked outside the cafe. The signs said the parking needed to be prepaid but we couldn’t see any machines. Giving up (admittedly rather quickly) we just headed inside to eat.

Afterwards we were thinking about walking around a bit when we started wondering about those machines again. Eventually we did find one, which only gave options for overnight parking or five hours for $25.

We weren’t sure what to do. Clearly the parking was designed with more visitors in mind. Reports I’ve read warn that it can take 15 minutes to find a park at Milford Sound. We had parked in the smaller parking lot, which was less than 20% full, while the larger parking lot across the road held only a single car.

“Was anyone actually bothering to check parking with so few cars?” we wondered to ourselves. We’d already been parking for free for 20 minutes. Could we get away with staying here another half hour? We really didn’t feel like $25 was worth it for the two tiny walks.

Eventually we decided not to risk whatever the non-payment penalty might be and snapped a couple of pictures on the shore and left.

Returning to near the Key Summit track we found the trail to Lake Marian.

Betty remembered to bring her hiking boots as it was noted that the track can be muddy. I of course forgot (brought them but forgot to change) but fortunately the track was quite well made.

Well, the first five minutes were well made. After the rapids the track became unmade. Not hard to follow – just one of those tracks where you had to watch your feet to avoid the various roots and rocks.

> Betty enjoying a rare moment of sun

I will note that Betty loved this walk through the forest. There was something about it that enchanted her, perhaps similar to how I felt during that the section of the Keppler track. I believe Betty used the words “fairy tale” at least three times while we walked to the lake and back.

Now let’s get this out of the way – Lake Marian was really nice

> Really nice

It was getting rather late in the day but fortunately the sun was still high enough that the water was the bright greeny blue (or bluey green, depending on the viewing angle) that the photos had promised.

This isn’t even a set up where I am going to complain about it later. Lake Marian was reputed to be one of the best trails in the area. And we won’t blindly agree to anything (see above regarding the Key Summit) but Lake Marian is great.

> Great

And very clear too.

And let’s not forget that it was surrounded by mountains – some still with snow clinging despite being very late into summer. It really was very scenic.

> A bit sad – once upon a time there was a glacier here

It reminded us a lot of Lake Louise and Lake Moraine in Canada. Both were similarly coloured lakes fed by melted snow and/or glaciers. However the difference is that the North American lakes were flooded with tourists. This lake, after a 1.25 hour hike in a semi-remote part of New Zealand’s South Island was almost private.

And there is also something about having to put in a bit of effort (even if the walk wasn’t that long) to reach the destination that makes the reward that much sweeter.

> Betty enjoying her sweet reward

We ended up walking round some of the lake, to see some different angles. By the time we were heading back, it was becoming quite late in the day and the mountains were casting their shadows over the forest.

I would rate this as quite a successful outing. We achieved what we set out to achieve and saw some really neat places. We just have to hope that the harder walk we saved for tomorrow is somewhat as good.
