Today was actually a nice day. So we went to the beach.

This was a walk down to a beach called Tunnel Beach. Not sure why. It could be because of this tunnel through this rock:

But that seems a bit odd. For starters, that tunnel isn’t even part of Tunnel Beach – which is located down this man made underground passage:

So we may never know how “Tunnel” Beach got its name. It’s also really not much of a “beach”:

It wasn’t very wide and was just a bunch of various sized rocks. Not much to do but head back up through the secret passage.

After walking back up the hill (which took a while and got us quite warm) we drove north along the Otago Peninsula to another sight to see. Victory Beach is a 3 kilometre-long stretch of pure east coast New Zealand beach located toward the end of the peninsula. But that wasn’t the only thing to see there.

Dunedin’s very own pyramids!

I’m not sure what your reaction to that photo is. You might be thinking, “Oh yeah, those look vaguely pyramid shaped.” If so, my camera skills have failed me yet again. In person, these rounded hills did not resemble the pyramids at all. If these are actually carbon copies of the only Ancient Wonder of the World still standing, then Egypt probably isn’t worth visiting.

Anyway, we continued on to the previously mentioned beach. This was a bit more impressive.

I haven’t mentioned it so far but we were the only people here. I get why people might not want to come see the round, uneven “pyramids” but the beach was still a perfectly valid reason to visit. Admittedly it was a 15 minute walk from the parking lot – which wasn’t so much a parking lot as it was an end of a road.

It was a really special feeling being on a beach which appeared untouched by human feet. It’s not often that we can feel alone and isolated in such a large, scenic space. We walked along, looking for signs of life – apparently sea lions and penguins might be found. We did spot something in the distance – possibly a sea lion or maybe just a rock. Despite several hundred metres of distance it must have seen us because it decided to walk into the ocean. It was also probably a good thing we saw no penguins. As they are easily frightened the signs instructed us to “hide until the penguin is gone” – which is very hard to do on a perfectly flat beach.

The only problem was the wind. The sun was out and doing a great job, but I would probably describe the wind as “not all that tolerable.” Possibly okay in other scenarios but not in a place where it can blow sand and make your legs feel like a sugar donut. So we didn’t stay very long.

While on the peninsula we figured we’d also check out Larnach’s Castle. We’ve both been before, but a long time ago.

Here is our visit to the castle:

While it was the prices that turned us around, it was only because it made us realise that we didn’t really care at that moment. By this point in the day we needed a break and a hot pastry filled with meat so we headed back into central Dunedin.

But that’s not the end of the story!

In the evening we ventured back to the peninsula again. Here is a scenic picture Betty took of me at a viewpoint on the drive there.

And here is a picture at another viewpoint after I gave Betty the option of going back out into the wind or having her picture taken in the car:

The place we visited was a somewhat highly rated walk to a place called Lover’s Leap. Like the beach it was quite picturesque on such a fine day.

But it was also like Victory Beach in other ways:

> The similarity is subtle

It’s such a shame. The first place we visited today (Tunnel Beach) was not really windy at all. But it was also further down the coast and therefore not really on the peninsula. Apparently the peninsula has a reputation for being windy – perhaps why very few people visit Victory Beach despite it’s splendor.

Fortunately some people didn’t mind a cold wind:
