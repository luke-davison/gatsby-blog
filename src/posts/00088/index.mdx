New York.

> “The City That Never Sleeps”

Where to start?

We arrived here around midday ready to spend five nights – the longest time we’ll ever be in one place on this trip. Our understanding was that New York had a lot of stuff to do packed into a small space. We figured five days should be enough to see enough of it.

The first thing we noticed was the temperature. Travelling from Florida we were expecting something a bit more manageable. The city is quite tall (meaning lots of shade) and the latitude of the city was as north as Palmerston North is south. It also can snow in the winter – so how hot can it be?

> “The Big Apple”

It was still quite hot. But it was more than that – it was humid. At the end of every day, the first thing I would do when we got back to the apartment is to turn on the AC in our room and then shower all the sweat away. Sometimes even during the afternoon we would have to seek out a mall, museum, Starbucks, or somewhere else that was air conditioned as walking around the city in the summer heat was very sweat inducing.

We had one afternoon of rain while we were there, almost fittingly it was as we came out of the 9 / 11 museum. It had been warm in the morning so that just made it more humid.

Also, the subway terminals (all underground) tended to be very hot. They appeared to be pumping the hot air out and into the streets through grates in the sidewalk – which just made walking around just that much hotter. At least the subway cars were air conditioned.

> “New Amsterdam” (prior to the British showing up and kicking the Dutch out)

So that’s all I’m going to talk about my sweatiness for now. I know stories like this is why you read this blog. After New York we’ll be in Canada so this might be the last time we have a problem with the summer heat.
