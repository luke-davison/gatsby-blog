Well, the day has finally come.

(*came – since those of you reading this live will know we’ve been back in New Zealand for two weeks by the time I got around to writing this).

It’s time to leave Jasper National Park. It’s time to leave nature and rejoin civilised society. It’s time to continue on to the concrete jungle that is Vancouver.

Well, eventually. Vancouver is a two day drive away. We’d organised to stay in a place called Kamloops – roughly half way there which split up the more than nine hour drive. However that meant that we could still fit in some nature-y things on our driving days.

At first we tried to see if we could switch our route up so we were travelling through Glacier National Park. This had come recommended to us and was back on the British Columbia Highway 1 that ran through Banff – an added bonus being that we’d get to drive the Icefields Parkway again. The bad news is that it would be an eight hour driving day. Not impossible, but since we’d told the rental car company that only I (Luke) would driving the car, realistically it would be too much.

In order to break up my driving time we researched a whole bunch of stops along the way. There were a couple of waterfalls to see shortly after Jasper. There was also Mount Robson – the highest point in the Canadian Rockies to see (from a viewpoint – not up close). There was a particular spot where moose were most known to frequent. We even found a four kilometre bird sanctuary walk to do.

…We ended up doing none of that.

You see, those pictures above were not taken the day we left Jasper. They were taken the day before. The day we left Jasper, the weather was quite bad. And unfortunately, it was at its worst in the morning – which was where most of the stops I listed above were. We couldn’t be bothered doing the waterfall walks in the rain. We *couldn’t* see Mount Robson in the clouds. And we didn’t even find the bird sanctuary (mostly because we didn’t look for it).

So we basically drove non stop to Kamloops with a stop for lunch at Tim Hortons. (By the way, Tim Hortons is pretty great considering how cheap it is. It’s basically a Starbucks that also does food).

The road itself was quite scenic. Lots of trees. Quite a few mountains. While we were out of the National Parks, nature was still around us.

That is, until we arrived at Kamloops.

For some reason, Kamloops did not ressemble the lush, green environments we had been driving through for more than four hours. Instead, it felt like we were back in Southern Utah. I would describe the environment as “desert-like”. Lots of rocks about. Few trees and fewer grasses and shrubs. It didn’t even ressemble the scenery south of Kamloops to Vancouver which was lush and green again.

I didn’t take any pictures of this landscape. The one below is as close as I got. But those of you that don’t want to spoil the next blog post should stop here

*LAST WARNING – SPOILERS AHEAD*

Okay, spoilers over.

So what did we do upon arriving in Kamloops? Well, we sought out the board game shop of course. It wasn’t that impressive. We tried to find some attractions but in the end we just stayed in our hotel room and watched TV.

Well, we’re getting towards the end now. I still have three more blog posts planned. Maybe I’ll also create one of miscellaneous images that didn’t find a home elsewhere. Either way, not too much more. Stay tuned for another blog post that may or may not have bears in it.
