At our accommodation last night we were asked about why we had come to Strathmore.  I spoked the truth, replying that we were here because Calgary was too expensive.  Calgary does have cheap motels, but they all sounded terrible.  Not sure why the "okay" motels are all more highly priced than the ones in the neighbouring towns.

Our next destination was a park east of Calgary but because we were already 40 minutes east of Calgary we had to scramble this morning to figure out what we could spend a day doing.  We ended up finding that a nearby town called Drumheller (check the spelling) had a bunch of sights to see in its vicinity.  So that's where we headed.
