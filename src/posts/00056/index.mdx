So I was re-reading some of the blog posts I have written and I thought, “Where’s that article I wrote about switchbacks?”. Turns out I only imagined writing it.

Hey – not my fault! It was a very busy holiday.

Switchbacks are something we noticed several times in the USA and thought, “New Zealand doesn’t really do that.”

Switchbacks are a way to lessen the incline of a path that needs to go up a steep hill, by switching back and forth. We first saw an example of this on day one in San Francisco when we visited Lombard Street:

But mostly our experiences with them were on hiking trails.

Example: We walked part of the way down into the Grand Canyon. As you can imagine, it would be impossible to walk a straight line from the top of the canyon to the bottom – because it would just be too steep.

The downside – the track is so much longer.

We next encountered switchbacks on the Angels Landing track. It has a section called the “Walter Wiggles”

This part of the path needed to ascend a steep section of cliff less than 10 metres wide. In New Zealand, we probably would have put in a set of steps. In America, they prefer to build a set of incredibly tight switchbacks:

While they probably took a lot of time and effort to build and they’re absolutely exhausting to look up at, they have some advantages. Firstly, they can hold a lot more traffic than steps as the path is wide enough for people to pass

The second is that they probably aren’t as exhausting, nor as tough on your leg joint as steps.

And that’s really all I have to say about them. Hope you found this interesting. To finish, here’s a photo of another switchback section in Bryce Canyon:
