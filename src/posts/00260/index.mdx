Today we got up with a less of a plan of what to do. Today was our last day in Honolulu and Dad really wanted to go get a certain geocache. Something about it being really old. So he bought a bus pass from 7-Eleven and off he went for the day.

Betty and I had our eyes on a walk called the Koko Crater Railway trail. However there were a couple of problems. The first is that it was a bit further out than the walks we had done yesterday. I know it still might be cheaper than renting a car but paying $30 each way to go for a hike seemed a bit pricey. Also the trail followed an old World War II railway track straight up the side of the hill. It would be non-stop steps in the Hawaii heat. How much did we really want to do this?

It turns out not that much. Instead we went for a walk around town.

We walked to Magic Island, which is a park on the sea shore and definitely not an island at all. At the end of the peninsula was a lagoon.

We spent a good while hanging out on the path by the sea.

And that's all the photos I have to post for today. We didn't really get up to much. After sitting outside for a while, we then sought out a cool place to have lunch. Then after a cool Walmart visit we returned to our accommodation.

However 5pm rolled around and I decided I really ought to try the water. The beach at sunset had been rather inviting yesterday. Surely it must be nicer than that surprisingly chilly Lake Superior.

At first it wasn't great. The sea floor was not pleasant to walk on. Not sure if it was coral or just spiky rocks. I suggested to Betty that we walk along further but she had got herself settled under a palm tree. So instead I tried a different and more populated part of the beach.

Here is where I found how nice it was to swim in Hawaii.
