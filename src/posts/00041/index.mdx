We woke to rain again today. But we could not just lie in and wait for nicer weather. Today we were moving on.

We were heading to the Catlin area, south of Dunedin. It is an area neither Betty nor I had been to before and since it would likely be a very long time before we come this far south again we decided to spend some of our days away from the mountains.

So our first stop this day was still in the mountains…

We found one last hike to do about an hour south of Te Anau. It wasn’t actually too far but the GPS estimate to get there was quite high – which could only mean one thing. Gravel roads.

One whole podcast later we made it to the starting point for our walk – Bormand Saddle. The parking area was already 990 metres above sea level. For comparison this was almost as high as the Key Summit we had visited two days ago. And we hadn’t even started walking.

The first ten minutes were through a silver beech forest. This was another forest that stunned us. The picture below still doesn’t fully show how it felt to walk through but it comes close.

The whole forest just felt “grey”. Everywhere hung this mossy grey substance – and I do mean everywhere (see above). It almost felt like it was matching the mood of the weather at the moment (grey). It didn’t feel dangerous or scary – just grey.

After that ten minutes we came out onto a ridge with the familiar alpine grasses and shrubs that we all love.

While we had a gap in the weather, the rain had picked up again 5 minutes before we arrived to start our walk. It wasn’t too bad. It was the earlier rains that were more of an issue as they had soaked the grasses, resulting in four very wet legs by the time we returned.

The walk wasn’t all that long – but it was up. When we reached the top there were some tarns, but one in particular hadn’t got the message that we were coming.

The others were on the best behaviour – proving perfect mirror images of the clouds that we were presently standing in.

It actually was really nice scenery. Such a shame we only got to it today. It was quite a drive and wasn’t near anything else. The road appeared to be going over a mountain range but no idea where it was headed. Perhaps the road was just there to service the massive power pylons going over the range – but then why were those pylons there? Seriously – I looked at a map. There was nothing east of this mountain other than more mountains.

> See – nothing at all in this direction

It did fine up a bit as we came back down. A pity – we might have stayed longer at the top had we known.

Next stop Bluff. Betty had never been to where State Highway 1 ends so we figured it was worth a stop to the sign at the end..

I don’t remember this but many of the directions on the sign are to places not all that notable. Kumagaya? Ruapuke? Suquian? Dog Island? They also spelled “Equador” wrong.

I guess the problem likes that everything in the world is north of us and it would be boring to just have all the signs pointing similar ways.

(I looked it up. Kumagaya and Suqian are sister cities of Invercargill in Japan and China respectively. Still a weird inclusion though)

We walked for a little bit at the bottom of New Zealand. I couldn’t help notice blue skies in the west and thick clouds in the east. Guess which way we were headed.

> I could draw a line where the weather changes

We made one more stop before we got to our accommodation. A lighthouse on the southern coast. Fun fact – most lighthouses are on coasts.

Also, Betty continued her streak alive of always having bad weather when visiting lighthouses.

There apparently is often seals on these beaches – perhaps when it is warmer and they want to lie in the sun. Anyway, after ten very windy minutes we just hopped back in the car and moved on. No need to linger – beaches aren’t much fun in the cold and wind.

So that was another day of activities. Is this what Southland summers are like – a bit of sun in between the cold and wind? Still, I did enjoy the Borland Saddle walk so overall a good day.
