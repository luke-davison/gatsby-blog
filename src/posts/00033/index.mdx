Today is going to be an easier day. We’re down to two must-do walks and so we’re going to tackle the easier of those two today. Roy’s Peak was quite the challenge and we don’t want to do two hard ones back to back. We may be crazy but we’re not crazy-pants crazy.

The forecast today was also for a chance of showers – so we had that to look forward to.

The walk was the Diamond Lake and Rocky Mountain trails. It didn’t take long to get to the lake.

It was more impressive from this angle:

As I said previously, everything feels so still in Wanaka. Every lake feels like a mirror lake, offering reflections of the hills and clouds. Probably the weather isn’t always like this – they must have windy days too.

And we can confirm that they do have rainy days.

Because it rained.

It was never hard enough that we felt like getting out our coats. But it remained a presence for quite a while. Basically all of our ascent up the mountain.

Fortunately we deliberately took the long way up, hoping the weather would improve.

Which it did.

I feel bad for saying this but compared to those around it, Rocky Mountain doesn’t feel like it should be called a “mountain”. The trail still involves 490 metres of elevation to climb but even at the top it still feels like the other mountains still tower around.

Still, there are positives. Being lower in altitude just means that you’re closer to the things you want to look at. It also means that we have fresher faces in our pictures. And we have the energy to do stuff like this:

I tried to copy Betty’s pose from yesterday with… less success.

I really hope this doesn’t make us look vain or self centred. The real MVP of these photos is the surroundings, but it is also nice to have photographic evidence that we were there. Having us in them helps convey the emotion we were feeling at the time. These blog posts are open for anyone to read I suppose, but mostly they’re for us to remember our trips.

Honestly we do take a lot of photos. We’re not experts at this. My motto is to take many and some are bound to be good. For every good one on here they’ll be one with a finger, another that catches the light weirdly, and plenty more that just didn’t turn out as I’d expected.

> Roy’s Peak is the big one in the middle

I suppose we are lucky nowadays. Carrying around a phone means anyone can be a photographer. And with everything being digital we are blessed with the ability to take hundreds or thousands of photographs. Even 20 years ago those last two sentences would have sounded crazy-pants crazy.

Anyway, back to the stuff that happened today. We stopped by the famous Wanaka tree to take a dozen photos of it. Here’s a couple of good ones:

I get the appeal – it gives the photo a focus point rather than just being nothing but water and sky with some mountains in the distance. But you know what’s better than a focus point?

Two focus points.

And this concludes Luke’s ramblings about photography to make up for the fact that not very much happened after we made it to the top. We walked back down from Rocky Mountain – I probably didn’t need to say that. Likely you figured it out when you saw the picture of me standing in the water.

So yeah, I’m going to stop typing now. Hopefully tomorrow’s story will be more eventful and I will go off topic less.
