The final day of the convention was the first time we turned on a TV in one of our hotel rooms. It turned out that the last day of the convention really consisted of some gaming in the morning and then the organisers started packing up at midday. So from midday we had nothing to do. We ended up trekking to Walmart on this day. But when we were back, showered, rested and rehydrated then we had nothing to do.

So we turned on the TV. Nothing much interested us but we did catch the end of Terminator 2 on one channel. A classic movie. Great effects.

It turned out that the channel was doing a Terminator marathon. I had never seen Terminator 3 so we started watching that. Terminator 3 got a really bad wrap but I was pleasantly surprised watching it. Perhaps the only reason it got so much hate is that the first two were both excellent and revolutionary. Terminator 3 follows the same formula but doesn’t have many fresh ideas.

After that Betty insisted that we watch Terminator 4 (aka Terminator: Salvation) as she hadn’t seen it. This is a very different movie to the first three as it is set in a post apocalyptic world where the machines have taken over. I didn’t care for it, but Betty liked it.

So that was our day. A nice relaxing day watching movies about robots killing people.

We did have trouble with the TV at one point. Near the climax of Terminator 3 the stream ceased to be at all watchable. At its worst, it would show half a second of the movie followed by ten seconds of nothing. Perhaps it was the afternoon storm interfering with the reception.

As we were watching free TV we also got to experience American TV advertisements (or more specifically, Florida TV advertisements). And because we were watching for hours, we got to see the same ads many times.

There were a number of ads appealing to America’s love for their servicemen. Some offered discounts for soliders, others provided services exclusively too soldiers. Some just used them in their ads. Being Florida there were also a large number of ads aimed at retired people. The weirdest one was for adult diapers.

Then there were the ads for medication. It was weird watching ads of happy people being happy while the narrator spend 30 seconds listing all the horrible potential side effects. Well, at least they were listed – cigarette warnings were disappointingly mild in Florida.

Lastly, there were the ads for lawyers. They would go something along the lines of, “Have you been injured? (Lawyer name) can help!” It made me a bit nervous to be in this country knowing that there’s a whole industry of lawyers ready to sue me if I ever cause an accidental injury. The other ads we saw for lawyers were, “Have you been diagnosed with Mesothelioma? Call this number for a free pamphlet about the disease.” (Mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos). It sounded like you would be getting information from medical professionals but the ad clearly stated, “This is an ad for lawyer services” or something similar.

We have also been seeing a significant number of billboards advertising lawyers. There were even lawyers for very specific things like “Motorcycle accident lawyers” and in San Francisco, lawyers that can get parking tickets reduced or waived.

Do we have ads like these in New Zealand? We don’t usually watch regular TV any more so I honestly don’t know.
