So you already know that we got up late this morning. As the weather was described as “improving” we decided to do some stuff in the CBD first. And by “stuff” I mean board game shops. Didn’t buy anything. Why do we go to all these board game places and not buy anything? Not sure.

Then we headed toward the museum when Betty correctly pointed out that there were no masses of condensed water vapour floating in the atmosphere above us (paraphrasing). I confirmed that she was correct, as the dome shaped expanse above us was a pleasing shade of a colour intermediate between green and violet (also paraphrasing – dictionaries are fun\!)

There were two walks I was hoping to do today. The first was the Red Rocks Coastal Walk which was a route toward solid mineral materials of the hue at the end of the spectrum next to orange (okay, I’ll stop – will revert back to my ordinary words).

It was a completely flat walk – which is kinda a big change of pace for us.

Not the easiest of walks though. The “beach” was frequently made up of sand the size of rocks.

The point of the walk was to walk to this one area that had inexplicably red rocks.

Not exactly the best reason to go for a walk – to see some slightly different coloured rocks. The main reason we came here was that it seemed like a nice walk.

It actually almost wasn’t a walk, as there is a road along the shoreline. Unfortunately we came on the one day of the week that the road is closed – so we had to walk. But this was perhaps fortunate as the word “road” in the previous sentence really should have an asterisk after it. I don’t think we would have returned with our car had we decided to drive it.

Anyway, we got to the red rocks but we kept going. Didn’t totally tell Betty why but Google Maps promised “seals” around the next bend. We got to where the map said there would be seals but there were none. Well, probably no seals – rocks look a lot like sleeping seals and vice versa. We passed the next corner and guess what we found:

> I think there are three seals in this photo. Could be more. Could be a hundred because of how well they camouflage. Definitely between one and a hundred seals in this photo.

Oh well, at least we got to see some. All three lying on rocks in the sun. Then another came in with the waves. Unfortunately for him all the good rocks had already been taken, so he had to swim around and find one that was suitable enough.

The sign said to stay twenty metres away from the seals. Here is Betty, definitely twenty metres away:

Then we had to walk back, in the sun. It was a nice change from hills. The ferries both went past. Off in the distance we could see the Marlborough Sounds, as well as a snow capped mountain. Don’t know what that mountain was – probably some sort of ghost mountain.

> What mountain?

Hmm, it didn’t seem to be in any of these pictures.

Definitely a ghost mountain then.

Tune in for the next post when Betty and I walk up another mountain which was definitely not a ghost mountain.
