Blue right?

San Francisco’s kinda aren’t. They are still blue-ish, but they fade to grey the closer they get to the horizon. Could be fog related.

I forgot to mention this my previous posts but San Francisco is very foggy. It just hangs about in different places at different altitudes. I didn’t photograph it but I remember seeing an antenna on a hill. I could see the top of the hill and the top of the antenna – but not the inbetween. This was in the afternoon.

> Some old chocolate place. They had a “World famous icecream sundae” – which is clearly a lie, because it’s not famous in New Zealand.

We’re now in Yosemite National park and the skies are the blue we all know and love. I wonder how long they’ll stay like that.
