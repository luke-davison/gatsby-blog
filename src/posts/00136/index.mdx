This is part two of my last post.

The wildlife park we went to actually had more than a couple of wolves and some bears. Not much more, but enough that I wanted to talk about them and I was running out of internet space on my last post.

Betty’s reaction to reading the last post was, “What about the squirrels?”

Yes, we’ve already seen plenty of squirrels in other parks. But Yellowstone squirrels are different. So much so that I didn’t even realise that they were squirrels until the sign at the wildlife park told us.

Let’s go back in time 18 hours. The date was Monday 1st of July. Luke and Betty had booked a room at the Roosevelt Lodge towards the north of Yellowstone National Park. Upon arriving, Luke and Betty were rather shocked at the quality of the room. Sure, it was passable. It was certainly achieving the “rustic” theme that it was going for.

> On the plus side, no other place we have stayed in has had a racehorse duvet

For one, we couldn’t figure out how to get the AC unit to blow cold air. All it said was to put the logs in and set them on fire. What does that even mean? Shouldn’t there be a switch of some kind? Or a dial?

> Fun fact, the roof wasn’t exactly watertight around the chimney area

(Seriously, the place was fine – it just felt like camping again, which was weird considering the other place was much cheaper and nicer).

10 minutes after arriving, I called Betty outside because there was a cute little squirrel / rat thing nibbling on the clovers. I knew she probably didn’t want to miss it. Predictably, she thought it was cute too. It wasn’t until we started looking around further that we realised – they were pretty much everywhere.

> Never mind those bear photos, I can barely spot the squirrel here

So much for, “Betty, come quick or you’ll miss it!”

Anyway, there were lots of these squirrels at the wildlife park.

Including this really fat one.

> “I’m a squirrel. Why would I need a summer bikini body?”

The back section of the park held several aviaries. All the birds were ones that for various reasons wouldn’t be able to survive in the wild. Eg, hit by a truck and can’t fly any more (apparently that’s quite common for birds that eat roadkill).

The types of birds in this section were quite interesting, including different kinds of hawks, some owls, a turkey vulture, and three American bald eagles.

They were pretty to look at. But they didn’t do much (although I’m not blaming the owls – you guys can sleep if you want to).

Fortunately, we were there during feeding time. We got to see a keeper go into each cage and desposit some tasty treats. I couldn’t tell for certain, but these treats were either mice, or parts of mice. We were expecting a feeding frenzy of sorts. Instead, the birds kinda just… stayed where they were.

They almost looked annoyed. As if they were thinking, “Plain mice again? Where’s the terikayi mice, or peanut satay mice?”.

> “A side salad would have been nice!”

Eventually (like an hour later) some of the birds started eating. In a way, I kind of preferred when they weren’t. I’m not going to be too graphic, but I will say that I learned some things about a mouse’s digestive system.

> “Do I even want this? Dave an Erik are probably judging me right now. Perhaps I’ll just have a couple of bites. Wouldn’t want to get too fat.”

While this was happening, I was running back and forward between the birds and the bear enclosure. I wanted to see what happened with the birds but it was time for “Sam” the park’s largest bear to be released. Literally twice as large as the other bears. He wasn’t a Yellowstone native – he’s from a far away place called Alaska where bears get a lot bigger.

> 1,000 pounds of bear

While certainly impressive to see, Sam didn’t really do much except forage under the rocks for the hidden food. The ravens, who flocked to the bear enclosure every time food was hidden, barely paid him any mind.

> “Guys. Can’t you read? This is a ‘bear’ enclosure.”

We found out later that Sam was basically as old as a bear gets. All Sam wanted to do was just to eat his food, and then go back to have a lie down out of the sun.

I can relate to that.
