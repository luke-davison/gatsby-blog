Today we're returning to Yosemite, and things are a lot different to yesterday. The sky is blue and we're early.

Actually we're not that early, but more on that later. Today we plan to hike inside the valley - which is where all the trees and pleasant weather is.

We hadn't yet done the park's most popular hike - a 10 kilometre, 4+ hour loop to two waterfalls. We managed to secure parking outside the "village" we stayed in last time. Then we had to wait to catch the bus to where the walk starts.

At the start of the trail was a sign warning about bears. It was meant to educate how far away you should stay if you see a bear. However again, this is the most heavily trafficked path in the park. I don't think we're going to see any bears. And to show how un-serious I was taking this warning I then proceed to fake-ride the sign.

> It's funny - if this was a real bear then this would be really scary

The first part of the trail was fully paved and not as flat as I was expecting.

You know its a popular walk when the local squirrels are ball shaped.

The most popular part of this path is called the Mist Trail. We don't know much about it other than it is closed for maintenance on weekdays. And yep - today is a weekday. Fortunately it is only closed until 3pm. Our plan is to go the other way round the loop and hopefully if we take enough time it will be 3pm by the time we get to the Mist section.

For now we had to take the John Muir trail, which is unpaved but otherwise still an excellent trail. The John Muir trail runs all the way back to Sequoia National Park and is part of the prestigious Pacific Crest Trail. But that's a bit more ambitious than what we're doing today.

The path started climbing giving us some nice lookouts back towards the main valley. It was certainly stunning - the far walls were awash with sunlight. But something we noticed is that our photos we were taking were a bit lacklustre. This was because when we stood in the foreground we were still in shadow.

I suppose it's a blessing that we had shade this late in the morning. We are going up a pretty steady incline after all.

We arrived at the next junction and were greeted with the sight of a waterfall.

But which waterfall is this? There's two on this trail - Vernal and Nevada. Had we been able to walk the Mist trail first then we would have encountered Vernal first with Nevada being the furthermost point in the loop. Judging distances is hard so while we had taken a photograph of the trail map, we still weren't sure which this was.

![Image](PXL_20231003_201849396.jpg)

We soon figured out it was Nevada Falls. We're not sure where Vernal Falls was but we missed it (although we will see it later).

It was around this time we figured we should stop for lunch. We were currently on a path looking out toward Nevada Falls with a steep drop on one side and a solid rock wall on the other.

![Image](PXL_20231003_204257613.jpg)

So we figured, why not here?

![Image](PXL_20231003_205554018.jpg)

It was a bit close to the people walking by (and also very close to the cliff edge) but it was a scenic place to eat our Subway sandwich.

The far end of the loop is that top of Nevada Falls. From here you get the highest view back over this section of the valley.

Some might say this would have been a better place to eat lunch, considering it was only five minutes of walking from that scary ledge where we stopped.

Naturally there was a lot of people up here. There's a fair chance they're all doing the same thing we are - delaying their descent until 3pm. Anyway one of them wanted a photo with the big rock dome so we exchanged photos.

It will surprise no one if I told you that Betty and I are not the same height. Our selfies together can be a bit uneven. Sometimes Betty might stand on a raised area to help reduce the height difference and this is one of these times. However, I don't think we got it quite right.

After spending a while attempting to get a good view of the waterfall and failing because we're standing above/behind it, we started down the path to continue our loop.

![Image](PXL_20231003_213025978.jpg)

Here we got the best views of Nevada Falls yet.

![Image](PXL_20231003_215806079.jpg)

Following the stream we came to the top of Vernal Falls. Like Nevada - we can't really see it from the top. However this one has a more pronounced edge where the water goes from flowing to falling. The lake above the waterfall had a very strict no swimming policy, probably for that reason.

To get down from the top of Vernal Falls it was now time to take the Mist Trail. There was still 10-15 minutes until 3 o'clock but it must have opened early. I could also see why this particular trail might need some work done on it occasionally.

> How did they even build this?

While Nevada falls was certainly nice (as well as taller), there was just something about Vernal falls that made it more pleasing somehow.

JIt was nice that we could get so close to it too. At this time of the day there was even a consistent rainbow.

![Image](PXL_20231003_224113568.jpg)

But boy was it busy here. I guess that's what happens when the most popular trail in the park is only open a few hours a day. We definitely had the right idea, coming down the steep trail. One pair of teenagers asked us how far they needed to walk - clearly already over all the stair climbing.

The mist trail ended up being shorter than we were expecting. Before long we were back on the paved trail that we started on.
