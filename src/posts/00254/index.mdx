Today we're returning to Yosemite, and things are a lot different to yesterday. The sky is blue and we're early.

Actually we're not that early, but more on that later. Today we plan to hike inside the valley - which is where all the trees and pleasant weather is.

We hadn't yet done the park's most popular hike - a 10 kilometre, 4+ hour loop to two waterfalls. We managed to secure parking outside the "village" we stayed in last time. Then we had to wait to catch the bus to where the walk starts.

At the start of the trail was a sign warning about bears. It was meant to educate how far away you should stay if you see a bear. However again, this is the most heavily trafficked path in the park. I don't think we're going to see any bears. And to show how un-serious I was taking this warning I then proceed to fake-ride the sign.

> It's funny - if this was a real bear then this would be really scary

The first part of the trail was fully paved and not as flat as I was expecting.

You know its a popular walk when the local squirrels are ball shaped.

The most popular part of this path is called the Mist Trail. We don't know much about it other than it is closed for maintenance on weekdays. And yep - today is a weekday. Fortunately it is only closed until 3pm. Our plan is to go the other way round the loop and hopefully if we take enough time it will be 3pm by the time we get to the Mist section.

For now we had to take the John Muir trail, which is unpaved but otherwise still an excellent trail. The John Muir trail runs all the way back to Sequoia National Park and is part of the prestigious Pacific Crest Trail. But that's a bit more ambitious than what we're doing today.

The path started climbing giving us some nice lookouts back towards the main valley. It was certainly stunning - the far walls were awash with sunlight. But something we noticed is that our photos we were taking were a bit lacklustre. This was because when we stood in the foreground we were still in shadow.

I suppose it's a blessing that we had shade this late in the morning. We are going up a pretty steady incline after all.
