We attempted the Tongariro crossing for the second time in March 2021 - six years after our first attempt - and this time it was very different.

The summer of 2020/2021 in New Zealand was both post-COVID and pre-COVID.  We had spent the summer out and about after the first lockdown in the happy time before the Omicron variation swept through the country.  Come March 2021 and Betty and I were in pretty decent shape having been on a 2.5 week hiking holiday as well as doing a range of other trails around the North Island.  And as summer drew to a close we had the thought, "why don't we do the Tongariro crossing again?"

It was a pretty good idea.  Last time it had felt like an endless lane of foreign tourists.  This time the borders were still closed, allowing none in.  Last time we were not hikers.  This time, very much so.

So we booked some accommodation and drove down late after work on a Friday night to give it a go.

I will say that the weather wasn't idealfds today.  No rain was predicted, but plenty of cloud - which might be an issue at the elevation we were at.  See the photo below - there's supposed to be a mountain behind me.  Very different from last time.

> Also different from last time - I have facial hair now

And naturally there was a lot less people this time.  There was no line of people covering the whole trail, just occasional group - like any other trail.

Then after the initial flat section comes the steps.  This resulted in a lot of stopping for us last time.  But this time, it felt so much shorter.  No stopping - not even a problem.

> We've come a long way from the hikers we used to be

Again, weather wasn't the best.  That's the disadvantage of this hike - it needs to be organised several days in advance but you're somewhat at the mercy of the weather still.

> Still no sign of Ngauruhoe

Another thing that has changed since the last time we were here is that people are no longer allowed to climb to the summit of Mount Ngauruhoe or Mount Tongariro for cultural reasons.  Climbing the former did sound like a worthy challenge, but there's probably plenty of other challenges we can attempt instead.

> Betty didn't mind that we can stay on the flatter path for now

Then began the climb to the highest point in the crossing.  Here it felt like we ascended into the cloud layer.  We were no longer able to see any views on either side, and sometimes we could barely see that far in front of us.  Last time we were here it was a beautiful sunny day.  Very different today.

It also got a lot colder.  I had to put on my warm clothing - something I almost never do.  Guess it was good we brought them this time even though they were just a hassle last time.
