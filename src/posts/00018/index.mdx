Okay, you may notice a shift in blog style from here on. The rest of the holiday was planned to be more laid back than our Queenstown excursion. No more packing days with multiple fantastic things. Just one thing per day from now on. And hopefully they are still fantastic.

The good thing about this is that it might actually give me a chance to catch up. Man, I am so many days behind. Still need to write more than one blog entry per day. We’ll see if I can manage.

Anyway, to summarise where we left off – Luke and Betty are at Lake Waikaremoana. The day is much nicer than it was yesterday offering blue skies once again. Reluctantly they pack their things and once again start driving along the gravel roads.

> Grr, gravel

There are ten “Great Walks” of New Zealand. To date I have done just one – and it was the one with no walking (not a joke, look it up). Lake Waikaremoana has the northernmost Great Walk – a three day, one way trek around the lake. I was curious about what made this walk great, so I organised our trip to come out this way.

> Here we go

We were never going to be attempting the full walk. Our plan was to hike the first part, up to a viewpoint, and then return along the same path.

Overall the part we saw was a nice walk in the bush, perhaps even a bit ordinary.

The occasional lake views were nice, but they didn’t change too much as we got higher and higher.

> Very lake, much water

After probably an hour of hiking we reached a clifftop with the full view of the lake.

Not bad, not bad. Certainly is scenic.

We shared the hilltop with a group who were walking back to the carpark (day three of hiking for them). They informed us that despite there being a higher peak further on, the views weren’t as good. So that was nice – we didn’t have to waste time continuing on. After a lot of hiking this week, our feet welcomed a bit less hiking.

> Happy hikers

Once we were back in the car, we headed on to Wairoa for lunch (small town, not all that notable – has a lighthouse).

> Fun fact – wasn’t even by the coast

Then on to Napier. During this part of the trip, the rain started bucketing down. Not that we cared – we weren’t planning to do much else for the day. We just checked in and had dinner.

Well, we also went to The Warehouse. But did that really need to be said? When its right by your accommodation, how can you not? Almost bought half a box of $1 Oreos. Both proud of and disappointed with myself that I did not. Betty found a nice little hat. I say little, but it really was little. The tag said “for ages 3 to 7”. I laughed, until I started trying on the men’s hats and literally none fit. “One size fits all” – that’s a lie.

And so that’s a story about how I can now say I have walked 1.16 Great Walks of New Zealand, and how we learned we both have abnormally sized heads. Hope you like more walking stories because that’s the plan for tomorrow.
