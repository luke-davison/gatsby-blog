There’s probably a lot of commentary I should give regarding where we are right now. And I deliberately mean many meanings with that. While I consider how to answer that (and more importantly, how to make it interesting) I’m going to share some pretty pictures of places we saw today.

Having awoken very early after a restless, humid night of sleep and still laden with all our stuff, we weren’t wanting to start off with anything too ambitious. Immediately throwing out all the planning I had done prior to arriving, we found a walk in Jack’s Point. I guess I’d call Jack’s Point a suburb of Queenstown. And in the morning shadow of The Remarkables, it is one of those increasingly common suburbs of Queenstown that is located outside of Queenstown.

It doesn’t have much other than a bunch of new houses and a golf course. And a walk of course. Well, that is what a list of Queenstown walks said. But while we parked outside the golf course club house we weren’t sure. We couldn’t see any signs, nor any indications that anyone was parked in the same lot for reasons other than golf or eating. After a while we just decided to start walking and hope that the track presented itself.

> I guess trespassing on a golf course can be considered a walk

Eventually signs were found – most of them helpfully pointing in the opposite direction. Perhaps we’re doing this walk backwards. Or perhaps the golf course doesn’t really like to publicise that people are free to come and walk straight through their expensively grassed course. Regardless, the track wasn’t always easy to find.

> “Betty! It’s over here”

While walking, I couldn’t help but notice how different this was to walking in the Waikato. To think we were there only hours ago. It’s almost confusing to suddenly be somewhere else with differences such as:

* The mountains aren’t in the distance and they’re huge.
* Houses all have the same 45 degree angled roofs
* The ground is covered in hardy grasses and shrubs – what I would expect to find next to beaches – and yet no sand is in sight.
* No one agrees that the Chiefs are clearly the best team in the competition and have just had bad luck these last few years.

(That last one is obviously a joke. You know we don’t talk to people, never mind about rugby).

I guess that means we’re doing our holiday right. We’ve come quite the distance to get away from it all (whatever “it all” is right now). Hmm, I seem to have been getting into that “commentary” thing I was talking about avoiding. Better stick with the plan and get back to talking about grass and clouds.

Overall it was a nice walk. Not being sure how much to bite off for this afternoon, it was intended to be just a short loop around a golf course. But then when we got to the first junction, we decided to make it a bigger loop and head back at the next junction. But at that junction we decided to keep walking in order to make an even bigger loop walk.

So overall a good start to our holiday.
