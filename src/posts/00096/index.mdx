So we’ve landed in San Francisco – which is nice. We’re two days in and we’ve done some things and I figured it might be about time to set up a blog of some kind. This’ll help me remember what we did, where we stayed, what we ate etc. Hopefully we’ll put up some nice photos and the blog posts won’t all be photos of random things we found (like this one is – sorry).

We were walking along an otherwise unremarkable street in San Francisco and we found this Pohutukawa tree on the side of the road. There was just the one. I thought it might be a good metaphor for us – kiwis far from home, alone in a strange land. I did a quick Google search to try and learn how it got there. The top response was an article mentioning how Pohutukawas in San Francisco are destroying sewer lines and pavements…

…So maybe this isn’t the best metaphor.
