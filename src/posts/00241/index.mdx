The date was May 8th, 2023. We had been travelling for just five days and already our travel plans had to change. The road to Cedar Breaks was still closed due to snow and so we had to go elsewhere. However it is now late September - the snow ought to have melted by now, right?

After five hours of driving, plus lunch and a whole bunch of scenic viewpoint stops, we were driving up to Cedar Breaks National Monument.

We directed our GPS to take us to the visitor's centre, which turned out to be closed for the season.

Huh? Hadn't the "season" not started until mid-June? Now it was already closed. That's a very, very short season for a park. What gives?

Well, the answer is that this park is located at over 10,000 feet in elevation, which is over 3,000 metres above sea level. At this altitude things get a bit... cold. Summer arrived late and then finish early. It was fine while we were in the car but once outside there was a noticeable chill.

I took one look at the sign and told Betty, "Don't worry, the walk to the viewpoints are only a couple of minutes."

> Do you see my mistake?

No, it wasn't "minutes" - nor was it "metres". The units on this sign were "miles". Okay, so this probably won't be a two minute walk.

So we packed our backpacks properly, put on our warm clothing and set off.

The first view wasn't actually that far along.

Within a few minutes we'd come out of the trees and were greeted with a panorama view of the park.

Cedar Breaks isn't especially unique. When I first saw the pictures I thought to myself, "That looks a lot like Bryce Canyon." It's not a coincidence. Bryce Canyon National Park isn't far from here - it's actually where we ended up going back in May when this was closed. But just because it is a bit familiar, that doesn't mean Cedar Breaks wasn't an amazing sight for us to see.

I really don't know why Bryce Canyon gets to be a "park" but Cedar Breaks is only a "monument". The definition of a "park" was that it had to be a large area worth preserving. Is this not a large area?

Anyway, wasn't this a walk? The sign said there was a place called "Spectra Point" - shall we go see what that is all about?

![Image](PXL_20230921_212549786.jpg)

Spectra Point was exactly what we were expecting - a point on the canyon rim sticking out slightly more than everything else. It wasn't bad, but it gave views of the same scenery we'd been looking at for the last mile.

But we weren't complaining. We were out in the fresh afternoon air (and boy was it "fresh") enjoying the hoodoos, spires, and whatever other rock formations we were looking down upon. So we continued walking.

Rampart Overlook was the same as Spectra Point - nice, but had the same view as the rest of the trail.

What now? We'd walked 2 miles which means we had to walk the same distance to get back. It would also be uphill on the way back. However there was one last point of interest which wasn't on the original sign called Bartizan Arch. I didn't know anything about it except that it was an arch, and the only reason I knew that was because it had the word "arch" in the name. It was half a mile away. Or maybe it was three quarters of a mile. Or was it more? The signs we'd seen weren't consistent. Do we go?

Well, we haven't been doing much walking at all for the last couple of months. I'm not sure when was the last time we did a proper hike in a park - we're definitely going to feel a bit wobbly in the legs tomorrow. However we were certainly still enjoying being here so we barely even stopped at Rampart Overlook before continuing on.

On the way we argued about what the definition of an "arch" was. We had learned the answer in Natural Bridges National Monument - how had one of us (Betty) forgotten already?

The arch turned out to be more visually interesting than we had expected.

The trail led to the overlook above the arch - which is a stupid place to be, since we can no longer see the arch. Or perhaps maybe the official trail doesn't actually go to the top, but it unofficially does now because of all the hikers before us. There was a surprising lack of signs here. Were it not for the visible arches then we wouldn't necessarily know that this was the end of the trail. There were also no signs saying, "Do not walk on the arch".

...which we did not do - but I did get as close as I wanted.

I don't think these arches are as fragile as they look, after all they're made of solid stone and have survived centuries of weathering. But that doesn't mean I was about to stand on it.

Now let me tell you something about our car - the brakes have never been great. When we did the test drive I noticed that they were the opposite of touchy, requiring a fair bit of pressure. I don't know cars and kind of just assumed this was what Nissan Versas were like. However after driving many thousands of kilometres I couldn't help wondering whether the brakes needed attention.

Well the road back down was rather steep in parts. Roads usually have warning signs for gradients of six percent. Well this road had a grade of thirteen percent in parts. As we were driving down our car started making noises. Then those noises started changing pitch and became louder. The noises definitely didn't sound healthy.

Putting the brake pedal all the way down I brought the car to a complete stop, but as it did the car lurched weirdly. It was as if one of wheels was an oval shape. "Do we have a flat tire?" Betty asked. I didn't answer because I knew she was correct.

I pulled off the road, put the hazard lights, then got out to see how bad it was. The tires were... fine? The one we had suspected was flat was definitely still inflated. So what's going on? I put my hand near the wheel and felt heat radiating off it. I don't know much about physics but I know friction creates heat - but is this a normal amount of heat? We didn't know.

Well what are we going to do now? We're halfway down a hill with dodgy breaks. I guess we'll just wait

// Set off for a walk, but there was never really a reason why we wouldn't keep walking. It was a long walk considering we have done very little walking over the last couple of months. Check the photo timestamps for how long it took - start was about 3pm. And for the distance.

// Increasingly more shadows on the rock structures. After 5 the sun was a bit glare-y

// Brakes started making bad noises on the way back down so we pulled over. Based on how the car shuddered to a stop we thought we might have lost a tyre. Fortunately it seemed like it was just the brakes overheating. Took it easy-ish on the way down. Not sure if we should get the brakes looked at/replaced.
