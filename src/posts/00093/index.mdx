So Orlando was quite hot. We had to empty our drink bottles before we went through security in Salt Lake City. I didn’t refill mine before we got on the plane.

The first thing I did when we got to our hotel room is to pour myself a glass of water. I sculled it quickly and poured myself another. It was in this second cup that I noticed something:

The water tasted disgusting.

In our trip so far the water quality has varied a fair amount. We have stayed in a lot of different places that get water from different sources. A lot of the water in the National Parks was once snow. In Grand Canyon we were warned that it might not be clear due to the very fine but harmless particles in the water. Regardless of how good or bad each place’s water was, we just topped up our bottles and continued on. Even water that didn’t taste quite right was fine to quench our thirsts during a day of walking.

But Orlando’s water was on a different level of badness. Here’s how bad it was:

We could smell it.

I poured a cup and left it out (because I decided not to drink it). When I walked by, I could smell the water. After having a shower, the bathroom smelled different. When we walked past the pool area on the way to the convention building, we could smell the pool water. Okay, for that last one the smell was chlorine but if it wasn’t present there still would have been a smell.

I researched it. Apparently it’s due to minerals in the water. The town could filter these minerals out of the water supply but that would require ratepayers to pay for the filtering, and Floridians are very anti-tax. I read once that Americans consume something like 200 single use plastic bottles per person per year. I now fully believe that statistic to be true.

So what did we do? Well for the first couple of days we didn’t drink much. We were sitting in air conditioned rooms most of the time so we weren’t exactly exerting ourselves much. On our first trip to the CVS near the resort, we purchased some juice and a big gallon of spring water. I considered buying the cheapest water, but was worried it might have been tap water in disguise. The water we did end up buying wasn’t exactly expensive though.

That might have been a mistake. Like before, the first glass quenched but after that, the spring water tasted just as bad as the tap water. We still drank it when we had to (such as on our Walmart trip). When we did, I found that the best way was to scull as much as possible at once as the aftertaste was the worst part. Otherwise we drank probably not enough liquid and too much of that was juice for our entire stay.

But we were never thirsty enough to open the $4 ($6 NZD) 600ml “Fiji Water” bottles in our room.
