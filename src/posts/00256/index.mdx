// Betty liked the motel and wasn't too keen to go camping again

// Long drive, listened to a lot of Wheel of time

// Stopped at visitor centre. Bought a magnet. Saw a thing called "candlelight walk" - asked about it but it only happens once a year around Thanksgiving (so we hadn't missed it but neither could we do it).

// There were some recommended walks on the brochure. There were also several parking lots that get incredibly busy with warnings to only park in designated spots. We figured the latter must be worth seeing.

// Drove up a bit of a hill to the Lady Bird Johnson Grove - don't know if her first name is "Lady Bird" or just "Bird" but she is a lady. It was really quiet here. No road noise, no wind noise, no insect or bug noise, and very few people so no people noise. Amazingly tall trees. Got sore necks from looking up. I don't remember Sequoia National Park being nearly this nice. Are the trees taller here? Or does the weather being better matter a lot?

// Grove walk didn't take long but we didn't have that much daylight left so went to campsite.

// After putting the tent up we went on the nearby walk, not knowing exactly how long it would take. I took the headlamp just in case.

// Saw the Big Tree. I foolishly looked the wrong way to find it.

// Got dark.

// Got warned by fellow campers that we were about to walk by a large elk. Horns.
