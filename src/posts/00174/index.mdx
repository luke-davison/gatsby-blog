We woke up yesterday wondering, "Should we go back to Colorado National Monument?"  It underwhelmed a bit yesterday.  Probably will underwhelm again if we just rushed back there today.  So instead I found a walk nearby called the Palisade Rim Trail.  There was nothing too special about it, other than having a mix of hills, views, and other things.

The views it gave made it clear that we're not in Utah anymore.

The walk itself wasn't notable at all, but at the same time we did enjoy it.  I guess it helps when you go into a walk with no expectations.

There was one unique thing we spotted on the walk.  We overheard a noise and saw what looked to be a large insect hovering around a bush.  But the thing was - it was a bit too large for an insect.

I'd call this a hummingbird, but last time we were on this continent we mis-identified a marmot as a beaver so I'm reluctant to identify anything new.  But we looked up what a hummingbird is supposed to look like, and we're pretty sure it looks like this. 

After lunch and a shopping trip we gave Colorado National Monument again (see previous blog entry).

The next day we decided to try a trail called the Trail Through Time.

This was a short and seemingly unremarkable walk except for one fact - this walk featured actual dinosaur bones lying in situ.  This sounded neat - dinosaur bones in a museum can feel a bit fake but seeing them untouched in the ground would be a novelty.

Well, it wasn't quite that great.

The picture above contains one Betty and one to two dozen dinosaur bones.  These bones are fused in the rock.  There is a picture nearby explaining the various parts of the juvenile dinosaur that died here, but it's not easy to tell what is bone and what is not.

But overall it was a nice walk.  Lots of long views of the surrounding and the distant mountains.

Not every walk has to be a winner.  Some walks can just be a pleasant way to spend a morning or an afternoon.  Of course, we have come all the way across the world to get here - we probably shouldn't always be satisfied with just "pleasant".  Or maybe we can.  Holidays can be whatever we want them to be after all.
