Waterfalls. We all love them. We all need them. If they didn’t exist, rivers wouldn’t be able to navigate large drops in elevation. But the question man has forever struggled with throughout history is, “Which waterfall is the best?”

There were a couple of waterfalls in Yellowstone. The first one we checked out was the “Upper Falls” (heard that name before) in the “Grand Canyon of Yellowstone” (again, not an original name guys).

Overall not a bad waterfall. It gets a couple of extra points for having lots of water.

We were going to do a walk to the Lower Falls but the track was closed due to safety concerns. We tried to drive round to the viewpoint but we missed the turnoff and then got distracted by a bear so we never made it.

Later that day we stopped at Tower Falls.

This falls was a bit of a let down. It raised the question for us, “Are we tired of seeing waterfalls?”

On the day after Yellowstone, we had four hours of driving planned but nothing else. So we brought up our route on Google Maps and examined some of the green areas (parks) that we passed by. We found a place very close to the highway called Mesa Falls. With nothing more planned, we figured we’d check it out.

Annoyingly, this falls cost $5 (per car) to enter. We had previously bought a $80 annual pass which had been getting us into all the National Parks so we weren’t used to having to pay to see nature. But $5 hardly breaks the bank.

The Upper Falls (third time we’ve had that name) was about a two minute walk from the carpark. It turned out to be quite a pleasant view. Not only were we the only people there (at the time), it was also quite stunning.

While not huge, there was definitely something magical about these falls. These next photos might give you a hint as to what made them special:

That’s right – there was a permanent rainbow\!

Betty even tasted it\!

Afterwards we decided to do a 1.1 mile “nature trail” to the Lower Falls. We figured, if it was worth building a trail that long there then that’s probably worth seeing to. Here was the view of those falls:

What happened trail? Why are we still so far away? Oh well, at least we got a nice up close experience with the Upper Falls. We also now know that we’re not sick of waterfalls. Some are just better than others.

It’s a pity our path through North America isn’t taking us to Niagara Falls. That would probably have been nice to see.
