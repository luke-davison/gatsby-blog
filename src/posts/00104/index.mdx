Yosemite National Park, along with Yellowstone National Park, were the two most highly recommended parks to visit in the USA. When we were planning our route, I pointed out that Yosemite, Yellowstone and the parks in Southern Utah (Zion, Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon) were kind of spread out. I told Betty she needed to choose only two of those three choices if we were to make it to our boardgaming convention on time.

She chose that we should be late to the boardgaming convention.

During our 3.5 hour drive to Yosemite, I was sceptical about Yosemite. Is this place really that good that its worth flying across the globe to see? We were getting pretty high up into the hills (6,000 feet) and I was still having doubts. Yes, there were nice long views from lookout points along the road of hills populated sparsely by trees.

Then we turned corners and Yosemite Valley came into view.

Seeing all the greenery and the absolutely huge rock formations instantly confirmed to me that this was going to be a place worth visiting.

Being up on a mountain is great. At the top you might be able to get 360 degree views. But trees usually put a stop to that. Plus getting up there is a lot of work. Valleys are definitely where it is at. 360 degree views (of the valley walls) but without the sweatiness of having to climb.
