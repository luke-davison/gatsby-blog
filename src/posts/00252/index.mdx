For our fourth day in Los Angeles we did... nothing. The only thing left on our "must see" list was Venice Beach and even though it was the only thing planned for the entire day, we never got round to visiting it. We essentially used the day as a day to plan the last part of our journey.

We also had some things to worry about. It was on this day that saw the news that the US government was two days away from a shutdown. Apparently the US government needs to pass several bills a year otherwise the government ceases to have authorisation to spend money and they have to shut down. Now we don't really take much notice of the US government news (we prefer to avoid talking politics with locals) however a shutdown would impact us in one very particular way:

National parks are government funded.

So if the government shuts down then all national parks and monuments have to close. That would certainly suck because for the next four days we were going to be staying outside of three national parks. We would also drive by three more on the way out of the country. Shutdowns usually last weeks so if it was going to happen on October 1st then that just leaves us one last day to visit these parks.

The weather was not looking good for today but we felt like we had no choice We picked the one national park we hadn't seen that was also within driving distance and set off.

Of course, the weather was sunny when we set off from Los Angeles! It might be rainy elsewhere in the state but that doesn't mean Los Angeles won't have blue skies and a high of 30. When we reached Sequoia things were quite different.

> Those are a lot of clouds up there

From the visitor's centre there was a single road going through the park. This road steeply zigzagged up the side of the hills. I imagine on a fine day this would be quite the scenic drive, looking out over the plains, but on this day the road quickly entered the clouds. So we saw nothing. And then boy did it become wet.

At the top of the hills were the famously large trees that the park is named after. We were now more than 2,000 metres above sea level. We've been a lot higher before but not in weather like this. But we came all this way so we may as well do one walk.

The one we picked out was to a tree called General Sherman. If the tree has a name (and a title!) then it must be worth seeing right? Well this tree is apparently the largest tree in the world (by volume) so if we were going to see just one tree today then it probably ought to be this one.

It was rainy and it was cold. But the walk was only a few hundred metres long so we ought to be able to do this.

> We just have to ignore the water rushing down the path

General Sherman was definitely... a tree. It was certainly big, but it didn't seem overly impressive. Was it that much bigger than the other trees around? I don't know - we weren't paying too much attention to the trees.

> They're all huge!

Despite the conditions there were still a lot of people that had come to see this tree. But we didn't gather with the rest of them. Instead we snapped a small handful of photos and then started back up the hill to the car.

As we got back to the car I went to fish the car key from my pocket and found it to be quite wet. Uh oh - its probably not a good idea to mix water and battery operated fobs. The button to open the car didn't work. Well at least we could resort to using the physical key to open the doors. But what were we going to do about starting the car? Our Nissan didn't have a key ignition. How are you supposed to drive it if the key has no battery? If we can't figure that out then we might be stuck here for quite a while.

I had heard somewhere that having the key really close to the switch is the answer. It didn't make sense but that's all I had to go on at the moment. It didn't work. But then it did work?. I don't know if it was something I did or if the fob just started working again. Either way it wasn't important - we could now drive out of the freezing altitude and back to regularly warm California.

That night we got the good news. While we were in Sequoia the government had temporarily averted a shutdown. The parks would remain open for now. The shutdown may still occur, but not until November. "We don't care about that," we thought to ourselves. We'll be long gone by then.

The next day the weather was still rather grey. It may not rain that much but it was likely to threaten to rain all day. We didn't feel like we needed to return to Sequoia (especially because it'll likely be the same as yesterday at the high altitude), nor did we want to rush on to the next park just yet. Instead we decided to check out a cat park we'd seen on the drive out of Sequoia. We didn't know what it was exactly but how could we not get excited at seeing "cat something" in big letters.

Project Survival Cat Haven sounded like a zoo, but it wasn't exactly. The only way to enter was via a guided tour. One had just started so we were taken straight in - before we even had a chance to pay.

> Lion

The park says it is a park dedicated to the preservation of wild cats. And they certainly have a lot of them. Our tour took us around the park past many large enclosures with a wide variety of cats.

> Cougar / Puma / Panther / Mountain Lion - believe it or not they'll all the same

To our surprise, most of the cats were quite active. In zoos it often seems like the big cats are quite lazy animals (lions especially) and often just want to nap. Well not here. Perhaps it was the colder-than-usual weather today.

Okay, well some of them were napping. The Pallas Cat in particular never seems to want to come say "hi" so they had to erect a sign with a picture so guests would know what it looks like.

It was a shame that we had to join a guided tour. We were always forced to move on much quicker than we would have otherwise. By now it's clear we're cat fans so we could have stared at many of these specimens for hours but instead we had only minutes.

> Jaguar

As you can see the park did have a reasonably wide variety of cats.

> Lynx / basically just a big housecat

The tour lasted just under an hour and ended with a pair of tigers. One was white and the other was regular tiger coloured. Apparently that's just how tigers work. Like how humans can either have brown hair or blond.

> Tiger (unpainted)

The tour guide then showed us how one of the tigers liked to play red light, green light. Whenever his back was turned, the tiger would advance. Whenever he looked around, the tiger would freeze. When the tiger got close enough, it pounced.

> Tiger (fully painted)

It was obviously "playing" but were it not for the chain fence, this probably wouldn't have been fun for the keeper. He admitted that the tiger didn't like him very much.

In addition to the ones pictured we also saw Caracals, Leopards, Servals and a very a lonely Cheetah. That's a nice mix but sometimes I wondered whether they are collecting these big cats for preservation reasons - or whether they're collecting big cats just so they can have a big big cat collection.

Overall it wasn't the nicest of parks (lots of dirt pathways) but it was pretty cheap if you compared it to other guided tours.

We ended the day in an AirBnB outside Yosemite National Park. We have three nights here and the weather is forecasted to only get better. We assumed California would still be warm at this time of the year (and we were right), but these mountains might be a different story. Our enjoyment of Sequoia National Park might have been dampened but we have high hopes for Yosemite. It hasn't let us down before.
