// 29th was just a planning day. We were intending to see Venice Beach and maybe Beverley Hills but decided we didn't need to

// 30th drove to Sequoia National Park. We found out yesterday that the US government is on the verge of a shutdown, which happens when they cannot agree on a particular budget. The effect is that non-essential services get shut down, which includes all national parks. In the past government shutdowns have lasted weeks. We were planning to visit several national parks in the next fortnight so this would be really unfortunate.

// We knew today would not be a good day to visit Sequoia because the weather forecast was for rain. It was actually sunny for all the drive there. However at the park we zig-zagged up a hill and it got rainier and rainier

// Since it was cold (due to the altitude) and rainy we decided just to pick one walk, which was a short one to General Sherman, the world's largest tree

// Afterwards the rain hadn't abated so we decided we'd seen enough

// Found out at the end of the day that shutdown has been averted to at least November - we should no longer be in USA by then.

// The next day we drove back to see a Cat Haven

// We were a bit disappointed that the park wasn't self guided - we had to stick with a guided tour.

// Lots of cats pacing around. It was a cooler day, which was nice
