On the 22nd of June 2019 for the first time ever, (insert age here) year old Betty Jarm touched the frozen white substance known as snow.

She wasn’t too impressed.

She said it felt like ice. She had also been told by her well meaning boyfriend that there would be snow on Sentinel Dome and so she had deliberately wore her big hiking boots. There was only this one small patch.

Later that day there was lots of it but she was forbidden to get out and play in it due to the “no stopping rule” on the Tioga Pass road.

Once we had left Yosemite National Park and we could leave the car again, there was still lots of it. Too much in fact. It was too cold.

Luke liked it though.
