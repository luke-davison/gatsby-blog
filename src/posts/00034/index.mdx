As I said in my last post there were some specific trails that we wanted to walk. And with days being finite in length and number we had to make the most of what they could give us. Today, being the first full day in Wanaka, we decided that we should do the most popular on our list. Wouldn’t want it being left to last and then missed.

Roy’s Peak appears to be very well known in Wanaka and by people who have been to Wanaka. In fact, it’s view point gets so busy that people have reported having to wait two hours for some time to take selfies and Instagram shots.

Also, before we continue with the story, who is this “Roy” person. Yesterday it was Rob Roy Glacier – is that the same person. Today it’s Roy’s Peak. The big bay Wanaka sits on is Roy’s Bay. Whoever he was he must have been pretty special to have so many big things named after him.

So we get up early. Okay not all that early. We’re hiking at 9:00.

Something to note is that Roy’s Peak is not a short hike. The time required to get to the top is almost always listed as three hours and (spoiler alert) that’s almost exactly what it took us. It also becomes very clear within minutes of starting what the track is going to be like. The track starts at the bottom of a hill… and it just goes up the hill.

No shade. No flat parts. Only upward. For three hours.

> Why do we do this to ourselves?

Most of it runs through paddocks, so we have more of those locals judging us with those judgey eyes as we walk past.

It also becomes very clear soon after starting why this track is held in such high regard. Something positive about not having any shade is that there is also nothing to block any views. And the views over Wanaka and Lake Wanaka from this track are pretty stunning.

> The view was like this all the way up

Two hours after we started walking we reach the fabled viewpoint. A group of people have just left so there’s no queue for taking pictures. We already knew it wasn’t going to be too busy. The track has a huge parking lot because (when foreign tourists existed) it needed a huge parking lot. Today there was at most a dozen vehicles.

The viewpoint is a short trail heading out along a ridge line. By this point the track has ascended 1 kilometre in elevation and we are now high enough to get a much wider view of the area.

It really makes you appreciate how large (and weirdly shaped) Lake Wanaka is. Lake Wakatipu in Queenstown gets a lot of love, but honestly Lake Wanaka might be more scenic.

Or maybe I’m just saying that because we’ve been walking uphill for two hours and we’re forced to convince ourselves that this is all worth it.

We actually didn’t get great pictures from this viewpoint. Perhaps we should have studied everyone else’s Instagram photos more. A lady was kind enough to offer to take some photos of us together, but they were rather rubbish. At first I assumed she knew what she was doing, then she took the first photo in portrait orientation. It’s called “landscape” for a reason.

Anyway, complaints about good samaritans aside, we were not done yet.

We still had 300 more metres of elevation to climb to reach the actual peak.

Interestingly, the further we climbed, the better the view became.

Not sure why that lower viewpoint is so famous that people will queue for. Not five minutes of walking afterward we zigzagged back to the same ridgeline and got the exact same view, but even higher.

It also meant we got more chances to play around and find the right combinations of angles and framings. You know we’re having a good time when we get a bit silly with our poses.

Near the top we were also treated to a birds eye view of where we’d come from.

> So much zigging and zagging

Speaking of which, we made it to the top!

Again, I was amazed at how much better the view was at the top compared with the famous view point. Apparently some people just turn around once they get their snaps and don’t make it to the top.

Which honestly I’m kind of okay with. This is not an easy hike. A lot of people must hear that this is a great hike and so commit to doing it without learning more. I can understand if those people got to the view point and then decided not to continue on. The viewpoint is still an achievement.

It really says something about the city that this is their popular walk. Hamilton has the Hakarimata steps which is a great after work exercise. Roy’s Peak is four times higher.

We noticed this on our last trip – people in this part of the country just seem fitter. With walks like this it’s clear to see why. Not soon after starting we were passed by three people that we basically never saw again. And one of those three people was an infant! Admittedly it was being carried – but that just means its parent was extra extra fast.

Anyway, what I haven’t yet talked about is how getting to the peak means that you get a full 360 degree view of the area. Walking up we just see the Wanaka area. Past the viewpoint we get to see around the side of the mountain as well as seeing over some of the mountains to the larger, snow capped mountains behind. And at the top we are finally treated to a view south over the mountain range behind.

Admittedly not as spectacular as the green fields and blue skies and water – but it was still interesting.

We couldn’t help but stay up there a while. Wanaka area just seems peaceful. The lakes below seem so still and tranquil. Maybe it just seems that way because two days ago we were in blustery Dunedin but it feels really nice.

Like I’ve said before, when a walk is rated as a “must-do” we do approach it with a bit of skepticism. This is a “must-do”. Well, a “must-do” if you can do.

> Two who could do

I’m not sure we were fit enough earlier this year to do this walk, possibly even earlier this trip. The early-ish start certainly helped, as did the partial cloud cover, to keep the temperature relatively cool.

> A relatively cool Luke

Fortunately the way down wasn’t much of an issue. Just a couple of hours of slog. Hopefully our legs and feet will be okay.

> Sheep don’t care about human problems like sore legs

After all there is at least one other walk we’re hoping to do in Wanaka that is as long and as high as this.
