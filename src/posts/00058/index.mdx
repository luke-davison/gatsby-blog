It was a late start to our morning in Kamloops.  For one, we were in no rush to get to Vancouver as our Airbnb host had said the room wouldn’t be ready until 4pm.  But the main reason is that we’d stayed up late watching Ocean’s Thirteen and Law and Order: SVU.  I don’t remember exactly how late it was but it was past midnight – which was really 1am since we had changed timezones upon leaving Alberta.

We had researched stuff to do in Kamloops and not much had come up.  We were hoping we might be able to find somewhere to see moose but there didn’t appear to be anywhere in British Columbia where that would be guaranteed.  Oh well.  We did find out about a wildlife park in Kamloops which appeared to be reviewed quite positively.  So we figured, “We had fun at the last wildlife park – why not another?”

Naturally we made somewhat of a beeline for the bear enclosure near the entrance.  It turned out to be quite worth it.

These bears were certainly not shy about coming right up to the front of the enclosure.

> Hello!

According to a sign on the enclosure, they can smell the duck eggs in a nearby pond.  I guess they’re hoping that we’re bringing those eggs to them.

> “I smell them but I do not see them.”

We somewhat revisited this bear enclosure several times throughout our visit.  Eg, after seeing a couple more animals I think I said, “Let’s go back and see what the bears are doing.”

After we left the bear enclosure (for the first time anyway), we thought we spotted a raccoon in a bush.  It turned out to be these:

> What is it?

We didn’t get around to asking anyone what they were but I’m almost sure they were marmots.  Prior to arriving in North America, I don’t think I had ever heard of a marmot before.  Thinking back, what we thought were beavers in Grand Teton National Park may have been a type of marmot.  The only reason I didn’t think they were marmots at the time was because I hadn’t heard of marmots at the time.

> They walk funny sometimes – waving their tail around in the air

Anyway, these marmots were somewhat everywhere.  The deer had a huge enclosure but had decided to hang out in the furtherest corner from the viewing platform.  That didn’t stop us from spending fifteen minutes watching the marmots run around the rest of the enclosure.

As for other animals, here’s a porcupine we saw.  It almost looked fluffy (not going to touch it to find out though).  It was either cold or bored because it wouldn’t stop pacing around its enclosure.

We saw a couple of raccoons.  They weren’t that interesting.  I guess they’re mostly nocturnal because their enclosure was darkened (hence why there’s no photo here).

Then there was a number of enclosures which appeared empty.  So we missed seeing the Patagonian mara (a rabbit-like animal with hooves) and camels (that’s fine – we’ve seen them before).  But there were two major enclosures that it would have been nice to see animals in.

The first was the Kermode bear – a albino black bear famously referred to as a “Spirit Bear” by the indigenous people.  It was somewhat native to British Columbia so it certainly would have been good to see here.  The second was the actual black bear enclosure.  Until now we weren’t sure whether we’d seen a black bear.  It would have been nice to see one for sure.

But, what can you do?  We can’t expect wild animals to do what we want all the time.  At least there were a decent amount of other animals to see – including this guy:

> It’s a bit hard to tell how big this turkey was in this photo but it was huge – somewhere between half a metre and 10 metres tall (I’m bad with estimating).

This park had a kind of “farm” section.  I got kind of excited when the park information said there was a “petting zoo” section.  Not going to lie – after failing to pet the bunnies in Banff, I kind of wanted to right that wrong here.  But the petting zoo section didn’t have bunnies – mostly just sheep and goats.  They don’t need petting.  Plus, we have plenty of those at home.

> I feel like we don’t see donkeys that much in New Zealand. Also, we saw some mules back at Grand Canyon. Did I forget to talk about those?

Eventually we made it all the way round the park.  Then begged the question, “What do we do next?”  Answer: “Go round the park again and check on the enclosures where we couldn’t find animals. Well, after we visited the bears again.

> Two very nice smiles

As it turned out, this was a great decision.  To start, here’s that half bunny half deer animal I mentioned earlier:

> So unusual

Next stop was the Kermode bear.  Amazingly he was out! And active!

> He’s actually playing with a giant stick. He’s drowning it in this picture.

Looks like a polar bear, doesn’t it? Well, it’s technically a type of black bear. Also: Black bears also come in brown, “cinnamon”, blond, and blue-gray. In summary, whoever named the black bear was both unimaginative and didn’t do his research.

> See there it is! Kind of a pool noodle – but for bears?

So, if black bears can be brown, how do you tell them apart? Good question! Let me prove that I actually learned some things while on holiday.

The easier way is that grizzly bears have a kind of hunch on their back:

> Yes, this was partially another excuse to show you more bear pictures

And black bears do not:

> But can you blame me?

So, I hope this has been educational for you. Here’s what you should have learned:

+ Black bears are usually not black
+ Bears are awesome to see up close
+ And don’t be afraid to go round the zoo a second time if some animals are hiding the first time you go round
