Okay – it’s day two of exploring the Milford Sound road area. We only have one hike scheduled for today but it’s a harder one.

In fact, it’s rated as “expert” – the highest difficulty rating according to this sign at the trail’s parking lot. It also has plenty of warnings, noting that mistakes have resulted in injuries and death on this trail

> Scary equals good or scary equals bad?

But we think we’re going to be okay. While not as heavily trafficked as some of the other walks, this was still one done by a lot of people. Since we have some experience hiking, we should be okay – even if this is a bit trickier than what we’re used to.

Now, the first challenge is that the trail wasn’t always clear. Regularly it was quite thin and obscured by the alpine grasses which we had to brush our feet through as we walked. Sometimes it wasn’t obvious if we were still on the path or whether we were following the trail of previous hikers who accidentally strayed from the path.

After 20 minutes Betty asked, “Um, where are we going?” And it was a perfectly valid question. We were heading up to a place called Gertrude Saddle (a “saddle” being a low point in a mountain range between two peaks). However, it looked like we were just heading into a valley with vertical rock walls hundreds of feet tall on all sides.

> Three literally unclimbable valley walls

I assured Betty that this walk can’t just be a joke walk. We probably aren’t going to get to the end of the valley and find a sign saying, “You’ve been pranked. There is no Gertrude Saddle.” There was one corner of the valley that might be hiding something – likely terrain suitable for walking.

> …but what’s around this corner?

And it turns out I was wrong. No, there was no sign. But the terrain wasn’t always easy to walk on. There was a lot of Up. But that just means great photos?

It was about this point that the wind started picking up. We’d started the walk in bright sunshine. Overheating had been a very real worry since we’d started very late in the morning (we slept in, okay – we walked a lot yesterday). Fortunately the wind was keeping us nice and cool. Perhaps too cool.

…should we have brought warmer clothing?

> Can’t get cold if we don’t stop climbing

We also started seeing other hikers. They were all dressed as you’d expect for people on a difficult hike. We watched as they got out their jackets when the wind picked up. I’m not sure there was anyone else in sneakers – not even Betty.

> I just want to be prepared in case I need to run away from a bear

For the record, the sneakers were a deliberate choice as we’d read that slipping on rocks could be dangerous and I actually trusted my sneakers more than my boots. I’ll have you know that they didn’t fail me.

Eventually the path stopped being loose rocks and became solid rock face. The rock appeared very smooth – work by the glacier that used to occupy this entire valley. The warnings at the start noted not to attempt this hike during wet weather as the slippery rocks would be dangerous. This was why we’d left this walk until today – as long after the rainfall from Saturday as possible.

(The warning sign also noted that it rains in Fiordland more than 200 days a year. If we also take out all the winter months where much of the train might have snow – that doesn’t leave all that many days for this trail to be attempted).

In two places there were also chains to help – including one 30 metre stretch up otherwise smooth rock.

> The track is getting rather technical now

It turned out not to be that hard to walk up the rock faces. They looked smooth but as long as everything was dry they were surprisingly grippy. However while going up alongside the second face we begun to have doubts about whether we could do this.

This particular section had a dropoff to the right – which was where the wind was trying to blow us. The wind had picked up further as we climbed higher. It had been a true blessing previously as it provided much needed cooling – we would have ascended a lot slower and consumed much more water otherwise. However it was now getting cold enough that climbing faster might not be enough to keep ourselves warm.

With the added danger of the wind – which would probably only get stronger and colder as we ascended – should we continue? We could actually see the top of the saddle now, although it was still a long way away.

Again, perhaps foolishly, we decided we were not quitters. However this time we got a break. Probably five minutes or so of climbing later and we found that the wind had dropped – almost completely.

> A nice, still, happy moment with flowers

I don’t know if we were now in a pocket of still air or whether the wind just decided it had blown enough. Whatever the reason, we were now happy to continue on.

Although the wind had now brought some clouds. No longer was it a bright blue sky overhead.

We made it to the top of the saddle which promised us views out to Milford Sound itself. While not untrue, it wasn’t exactly a clear view (see below). We also discovered where all the clouds had come from. They appeared to be stuck on the western side of the range.

> Milford sound is in that triangle at the back between two ridges and the clouds

I had expected the top to be the windiest – presumably the wind would rush over the saddle since it was the lowest point in the range. But it was actually quite calm.

We even had a couple of keas fly overhead (not close enough to photograph and the only reason we knew they were keas because someone else identified them).

We made it in 2 hours, 15 minutes. Not too shabby – thanks cooling wind. A return trip was expected to take 4 – 6 hours so we’d made good time.

However it had frequently been a challenge climbing over and up increasingly large rocks to get here. Would downhill, with our legs half spent, be where the greatest challenge lay?

> Getting cloudier

Actually it turned out not to be too bad. While not fast (no reason to race), we made steady progress all the way down. The wind picked up right where we’d left it but no longer seemed so strong. I actually didn’t mind just strolling down the 30 metre chain assisted section, trusting my legs and shoes to stay gripped to the rock.

The blue skies also returned – the clouds having been mostly being kept on the other side of the mountain range.

And before we knew it we were back at our car (that’s a lie – the valley floor section seemed to take ages).

We had one last night tonight in Te Anau before moving on – so we wouldn’t be back to this region. As we drove out, we pulled over a few times to snap a few last snaps of Fiordland.

Having seen some of the National Parks in the US, it often feels like we don’t have such things in New Zealand. However this Milford Sound road comes quite close.

Sure it’s not to the same scale as those larger parks, but in many ways it gives the same feeling. As you drive along the road you’ll see regular signs advertising hikes or campsites. There’s regular stopping bays and parking lots for viewing points or short walks. And let’s not forget the large helping of natural beauty.

> A lake so clear we could see the birds diving underwater

One big difference is the relatively few other people – at the moment anyway. Sure there are a number of cars about but from what I’ve read and heard this one road can be quite busy. It was certainly a blessing that we were able to visit it when it was quiet and is a far cry from the packed buses we’d encountered in Utah.

> Goodbye scenic road

What’s next for Luke and Betty? Stay tuned to find out. But just a hint – the weather report says the rain might be returning.
