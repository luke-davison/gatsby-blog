Two days ago we reached the Ben Lomond Saddle. While standing there enjoying the view we saw another track heading North from the saddle into the valley beyond. Having enjoyed our Ben Lomond summit trip we decided we might as well try this track too.

It did mean we had to hike back up to the Ben Lomond Saddle – a full kilometre in elevation above Queenstown. Again, if only there was another way.

> Another way

Fortunately we still had one more day of our gondola pass (and was the main reason we were doing this hike today and not tomorrow).

Once at the top of the gondola we spotted a couple of paragliders. The wind seemed like it might have been going in a different direction because they were able to stay at the gondola height for quite some time. Does this mean that I got cheated out of some minutes on my flight because the wind was going in the wrong direction? Oh well, given my queasiness yesterday that was probably a good thing.

Near the gondola there is also a small forest that I haven’t mentioned before. It has the striking effect of being incredibly dark – especially on a sunny day. It feels like you’re walking from day to night (at least until your eyesight adjusts). It was also the only major section of shade we’d be having on this walk.

Hiking up to the saddle was a bit different today. Sure the sun was out, but there were still a bunch of clouds hanging around. Lomond peak was obscured, as we’d seen it on previous days. No matter though – the sun would likely burn this all away shortly.

Coming over the top of the saddle we were greeted with mostly clear skies and clear views. So that was nice. Everyone else turned left to go up the mountain leaving us to continue on by ourselves.

In fact, we basically had the track to ourselves for the entire walk. One runner passed us going in the other direction but that was basically it.

This track was called the Moonlight Track. It is called that because no one should ever attempt to navigate it by moonlight. It was a lot wider than than the “track” up that hill from yesterday, but it’s hardly fair to compare them.

The good news is that the clouds had parted from Ben Lomond. At least the suckers we’d seen hiking up there today would get some views.

The path continued along the side of the hill, at a constant but ever so slight descent. To our left we always had quite stunning views of the surrounding hills and some mountains. I’m assuming that one of the mountains we saw was Mount Aspiring – I just don’t know which of the snow capped peaks it was.

After a while, we had to cross a fence line and the path took us into fields.

And this is where things got a bit less pleasant. For some reason the fields were covered in poo. I say “for some reason” because for the hour that we spent going through these two fields (they were big fields), we only saw two animals.

I seriously don’t want to understate how much poo there was.

Eventually we were led down and out of the fields. The sign still said we had two hours to go.

This was not a short walk.

There were some neat views of nearby valleys but by this point we were more focused on getting to the end than stopping to enjoy the surroundings.

The track ended in Arthur’s Point – another Queenstown suburb outside Queenstown (aka a town I guess). From there we had to catch the bus back into Queenstown. A 5 – 10 minute bus ride to save a 55 minute walk along the road. Fortunately we were on time for the bus. Unfortunately we still felt like we had to run down the last couple of streets to ensure we got to the stop before the bus.

So – you want our thoughts on the track?

It’s nice. Has nice views. Lots of grass and mountains.

You want to know what the Moonlight track provides that the Ben Lomond Saddle / Summit track does not?

Not too much. Most of the track is out of the alpine elevation. It’s a farm walk with views. Perfectly good, but there’s a number of other walks that should be prioritised over this one.
