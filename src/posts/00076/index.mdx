Upon boarding our Air Canada flight to Quebec we noticed something unusual: Everything said over the loud speaker by the pilot or flight attendants was said once in French and then again in English. When we arrived at the airport, every sign was written in both French and English. When we were greeted by staff at the airport, they would always start with, “Bonjour. Hello.”

As I said before, part of the appeal of Quebec was its French-ness so to hear so much French being spoken was quite exciting. We had learned only a tiny amount of French: “Hello”, “Thank you” etc. We knew we couldn’t learn enough to be conversational so we knew we’d always need to fall back to English.

What we hadn’t anticipated was that most people in French Canada are not bilingual. French is spoken by 95% of people in Quebec. I don’t know exactly what percentage spoke English but it felt like well under 50%.

> Fun fact: we arrived literally four hours before the end of an 11 day music festival containing acts like Maria Carey, Imagine Dragons, Blink 182, Slipknot, and Kygo. I think I did notice that tickets would have been strangely more expensive had we arrived even one day earlier.

While we usually keep to ourselves, there were still many things we had problems with. Information signs at tourist attractions were only in French.

> Okay, I know this is in English. Somehow this was the only piece of text at a tourist location that I photographed, and it just happened to be in English! I swear everything else was French.

But that’s okay. It just meant we did’t learn as much as we otherwise could. It was the menus at eateries and ordering that we were afraid of. Previously we had enjoyed eating at Subway due to it being reasonably tasty, cheap, and healthy(ish) but the thought of having to navigate through all the various options in French gave us panic attacks. It’s often hard enough to go through these options in English.

> I think this means that the entrees will be served soon.

So what do you do? Well, we went to McDonalds. McDonalds has self-service kiosks. Even in French, we can navigate using the pictures. Even better, the menu could be changed to English. The only downside is that in order to pay cash, we still needed to interact with the cashier. So we’d smile when they said something and pass over the right cash and hope they didn’t say something like, “Sorry, that item is unavailable. Would you like ____ instead?” (which did happen once).

> Who would buy this monstrosity?!?

In general, we found that only in the hospitality industry could speak both English and French. But everyone else, we’d have to assume they only spoke French. Fortunately most times there would be one person at the restaurant who spoke enough English.

> And fortunately anyone trying to relieve tourists from their money spoke English.

So this was something we weren’t prepared for. It’s good to see that the locals haven’t abandoned their French roots but it did make visiting Quebec and Montreal that much more tricky.
