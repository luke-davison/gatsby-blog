Before planning this trip I had never heard of Bryce Canyon. But Betty had been looking at pictures of National Parks and seen some amazing images of several parks including Bryce Canyon. Bryce Canyon fit perfectly into our travel schedule as it was extremely close to Zion National Park which we were going anyway. So, Bryce Canyon was added to the list of places to visit. And that was that.

When we arrived at Bryce Canyon, I realised that I still knew nothing about it. I was picturing something similar to Zion. Instead, we found an experience similar to the Grand Canyon – where you could drive up and down the rim of the canyon to various viewing spots.

And what amazing views they were.

Bryce Canyon doesn’t resemble any canyons we’ve seen so far. It has a canyon rim and a canyon floor but no apparent opposite canyon rim. Instead, the view extends into the countryside.

I was blown away the first time I saw it.

To me this canyon is a solid rival to the Grand Canyon. Yes, the Grand Canyon has hugeness, but that’s about all it has.

Bryce Canyon has interestingness. Instead of a barren canyon floor, Bryce Canyon has trees aplenty. Instead of just having simple canyon walls, Bryce Canyon also has spires sticking up from the canyon floor.

And importantly, instead of just being something that you can look at, Bryce canyon is something that anyone can enter and experience. Grand Canyon was too hot and too big for its own good. Bryce Canyon is a more friendly size.

And if you just wanted to stare off into the distance, its got that too.

Bryce Canyon is also a lot less crowded. And somehow the skies are bluer than anywhere we’ve previously seen.

I talked in my previous blog posts how Zion underwhelmed. The difference between Bryce Canyon and Zion is that I came into Bryce Canyon with an open mind and without expectations. (Which is actually hard to do when you need to plan your expensive trip months in advance).

If you are near Southern Utah, I would say that this is the one place that you most need to visit.
