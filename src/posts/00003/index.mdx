So today we went to another wildlife park. We thought about going yesterday. And then we didn’t. Too many scary clouds and too many board games to play. However, we did find out where it was yesterday when we took the wrong turn testing the theory that I could find my way back to our B&B without Google Maps. I could – but it would have saved us 10 minutes and one U-turn had I just got my phone out.

I say “wildlife park” – it was really just a bird park. There were some lizards we had trouble finding (except for the tuatara – he’s pretty big). They also had eels that we could feed at 2pm. Just got to stick around for another four more hours\!

There actually weren’t that many birds – just two of maybe eight different types. First pen had Kakarikis and Kakas. We walked in and started the usual activity of figuring out the answer to the question, “Are there even any birds in here?” But then all of a sudden there was, as a Kaka came flying and landed on my shoulder. Very exciting – here’s Betty’s picture of that moment:

Fortunately the reason it jumped off my shoulder was because it must have decided Betty’s looked much nicer:

It stuck around for a while, before hoping up on Betty’s head. Then it started doing… something. Not quite sure what. It seemed interested in her hair. I guess that’s why Betty was preferred – I was wearing a hat.

Next aviary along was a Kiwi house – but it was being cleaned. Well, maybe it was. I mean, water was literally flowing out the door and 20 metres down the path. We decided we could just come back later.

After that we went along to an aviary with a Kereru (probably more than one but not sure) and some ducks. Like Staglands it was another occasion where the Kereru were visible but not all that clear through the lens of my camera so no pic sorry.

Their cage / house / aviary / thing joined onto another one that had a couple of Keas and a Weka. Well, probably a Weka – he was a bit hard to find. He seemed to have a large hut on the ground but it was hard to see if he was inside.

The Keas were more interesting. They had just been fed so they were hanging about close to the path. They had a variety of foods, and some milky liquid. It was kind of funny watching them try to drink it. I don’t think those beaks were made to drink out of a cup.

After a while the one with the beak covered in breakfast hopped down on the path and then started wiping it on the small wooden bridge. Clever birdy. But then that got me thinking – perhaps this was what that Kaka was doing with Betty, cleaning its beak on her hair.

Anyway, Keas. I’m really happy we got to see some – I don’t actually remember having ever seen them before in my life. And now twice in about a week – both times in close proximity. Sure, we came down to Wellington for the walking but it’ll probably be the wildlife I most fondly remember.

…but that was about it. We’d kind of gone through all the aviaries now. There was a twenty minute bush walk – not too exciting. There was a butterfly garden which was low on butterflies and gardens. There was big lawn with a whole bunch of ducks…

…which reminds me – they were selling duck food at the entrance.

You know I bought some. Just one bag this time though. I tried feeding some of the swans since I wasn’t all that able last time – but they were a bunch of big jerks so they didn’t get much. Pukekos were a bit shy – not surprising since they were vastly outnumbered.

What now? Well, we basically just went back through all the aviaries again. Here’s a Kakariki:

Then the Kiwi house had stopped flooding so in we went. Inside was a hallway with a couple of small round windows. Couldn’t see much – it was very dark. I was about to move on when Betty realised the Kiwi was literally right below the window. Except, there was a layer of dead foliage covering the ground to a depth of maybe 30cm. We couldn’t actually see the Kiwi (most of the time) but we could tell where he was because he was pushing the foliage up as he moved around.

Imagine a cat on a bed, under the blankets. It was remarkably similar.

I thought I heard a Kiwi call so I left Betty by the small window and went round to the main viewing area. The Kiwis’ habitat was actually quite large. I could see the window Betty was peering through but it was right at the back. The rest of the enclosure appeared empty, but mind you it’s very hard to find a pair of brown birds, amongst brown leaves, under minimal light. The call that I thought I had heard just turned out to be a recording of ambient noises.

So we watched the Kiwi through Betty’s window as he poked around – occasionally showing a beak or a head. Eventually he went further along the wall and we couldn’t see him. We never did see him again, even when we came back. The keepers had done a good job of providing a stimulating environment but at the expense of good viewing. I sound like I am complaining but I know this is for the best.

We headed on again – here’s another photo of what the Keas were up to.

We ended up walking round the bush walk. Didn’t take too long. Saw some bush, and a bird flying through the trees crazy fast like it had a death wish. Also a red lake:

> “Aren’t lakes supposed to be blue? Or if they’re Hamilton lakes, brown?”

On our third trip through the aviaries (because, they might be doing something different) we finally got a good look at the weka. Like the first two times we peered into its house, trying to see if there was a bird shaped thing inside. It turned out it was behind us.

> Here it is, running back to the safety of its house

It was time to go, but I still had some food in my pocket. So I made the ducks love me again:

> They had me surrounded

Well, that was a good way to kill some time. We drove up to Levin for lunch, and then on to Palmerston North. Once there we drove into the city centre, trying to decide what to do. Instead we just looked at each other and decided, “Nah, let’s just go lie down.”

We did end up doing something that evening. There is a Christmas market in Palmerston North every year and we just happened to be there on one of the two days it is held on. To be honest, it wasn’t that great. Lots of crafty things like honey, or bath candles. We did end up buying something – a print of a picture that took our fancy. I didn’t take a picture so if you want to see it you’ll just have to come round (assuming we aren’t too lazy to hang it up).

Perhaps the main reason we went to the market was for the inevitable food trucks that would be there. Despite being a ton of people present, there weren’t that many food places. Which meant long lines. Betty had the smart idea of deciding what to have and then waiting for it. I took the other method where I couldn’t decide what line to join and walked round and round in circles. Eventually I decided, “What’s something I wouldn’t have elsewhere?”

So I bought a comically long sausage.

Okay, only three more days to go. I think we’ve already decided that we’ll just go straight home on the last day. Looking forward to sleeping in our own bed, under our own roof, with our own birds nosily nesting in said roof, waking us up each morning. Hopefully the cat next door will have encouraged them to move out by the time we get back.
