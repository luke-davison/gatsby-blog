Good news! We have a whole day and less than three hours of distance to travel.

// First stop was Pipe Springs National Monument. Free because we had the parks card. Essentially a historic place where we could learn about the history of settlers, mormons, and indians who lived here. Main building was Winsor Castle, built by mormons on top of a spring. It was built as a fortress due to potential trouble with indians, although this worry was needless. Essentially operated as a stopping point for travellers. It was a bit weird that this place of predominantly mormon history is operating inside an Indian Reservation.

// Walked up the hill a bit. Walked around, looking for chickens. Again debated buying the souvineer puzzle, this time deciding to. Was cheaper than at Grand Canyon.

// Next stop was the Sand caves. Bit of a walk through a desert, then up a cliff. Lots of people struggling with slippery sandy shoes. Bit of a shame to see lots of names carved into the stone.

// Rather long Subway stop.

// Arrived at Best Friends. Asked if we wanted a tour. Tour was confusing. An hourlong tour with no stops at 2pm (in 20 minutes). We signed up. No mention of cost. Turns out it was free. Went to a kitten room, but they were mostly sleepy. Walked around the gift shop and outdoor area until 2pm.

// Taken around the ranch and explained the various buildings and what they do. Something like 200 employees, 1600 animals. Horses, cats, rabbits, dogs, goats, pigs. Animals that either have behavioural issues of health issues. Lots of buildings for specific purposes - eg animals with certain contagious conditions. Also an extremely large cemetery, which brought things down to earth a bit. Apparently it was open to the public, and lots of graves showed signs of care. We were the only two people in the bus. There was another couple with a dog following in their own vehicle listening to the commentary on the radio. But they couldn't ask questions - we could.

// Along with the free tour, we also received a gift bag. It was also a shame we didn't know that they did $5 vegan buffet lunches. Since they were nice and a non-profit we figured we best give them a donation.

// Thought the Belly of the Dragon was at the end of the trail not the start. Difficult to get into, but lots of older people about so should be possible. Walked along the wash after, not knowing how far to go. Found a wall which we took as a good place to stop.

// Stopped at a gift shop, although all we bought was Snickers ice cream bars. Asked for advice on how to get back west. Decided on a road that ran past Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. We didn't come here because money and sand. But we did get a look at the dunes on the drive by.

// Arriving into Las Vegas at dusk. Got to see the lights from the highway
