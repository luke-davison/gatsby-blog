Good news! We have a whole day and less than three hours of distance to travel. That means we can faff about doing what we want today.

That's it. That's all the intro you're getting for this blog post. There's not many ways to say "We got up and hit the road."

Our first stop was to be Pipe Springs National Monument. We had seen it advertised on a jigsaw puzzle we didn't end up buying yesterday. We also know we can get in free with our national parks card. Other than that we didn't know anything about it. But we figured, why not? Let's go in blind.

The time was 8:20am. Google Maps said it would take 50 minutes to drive there, but also warned that we might arrive before the opening time of 8:30am. Um, huh?

It turns out the road we were taking crossed south into Arizona briefly. Arizona is in a different time zone right now and the place was on that stretch of road. It also means the title of this blog post is already wrong but it's still better than "Miscellaneous adventures mostly in Utah but some in Arizona."

Pipe Springs National Monument is a historic place devoted to teaching the history of settlers, Mormons, and Native Americans who used to live in this area. The main attraction here was Winsor Castle:

> It's a lot more orange than "Windsor" Castle. Also more chickens.

The fortified square structure was built by Mormons as a fortress due to potential trouble with the natives. This trouble never occurred and for most of its history it operated as a stopping point for travellers. Basically a nineteenth century B&B.

The park is actually located on land which is now an Indian Reservation - which makes it all the more weird to find a park focused about predominantly Mormon history here.

There was a short walk nearby and despite being in the desert it wasn't hot yet. So off we went.

The park also had a museum but the lighting inside was really dim. We had a brief look around but we really didn't want to be in there when we could be out here enjoying the pleasant sun.

Pipe Springs was just stop one for today. Today we were just planning to drive around and do a bunch of small activities in this area. However before we could continue driving, we were unfortunately sucked into the gift shop. The jigsaw puzzle from yesterday was also here and this time I was convincing enough that we should buy it. Now we just have to figure out how to get it back to New Zealand.

Our next attraction was Sand Caves. We'd driven this same road two days ago and seen the caves up in the hills near the road. Now we're back to check them out. This required a short walk and then a bit of a scramble up a part of the cliff. The trail was very hard to follow but fortunately there were a lot of other people about - so we just walked toward where everyone else was.

It seems a bit uninspired to just call these caves "Sand Caves". They were strangely rounded, tunnelling into the brightly coloured rock that Utah is certainly known for. However the floor the caves were very sandy so I guess it can keep its name for now.

It also had a bunch of windows out of the cliff face.

You can certainly see why this place got our attention when we drove past it a couple of days ago.

On the way back out we had to scramble back down the rock we climbed up. This turned out to be a bit of a problem. The rockface was rather smooth and everyone's shoes were now covered in a layer of sand. Ours still had enough grip, but a few other people had lost all confidence in their shoes.

Next stop was lunch. The less I say about this the better.

Afterwards we stopped by a place called Best Friends Animal Society. We didn't know what to expect - its website was not clear at all. Google described it as a tourist attraction and with 1,400 reviews averaging 4.8 stars out of 5 it sounded promising. But what was it? We when walked into the gift shop / reception area and we still weren't sure.

![Image](PXL_20230924_195051303.jpg)

The girl at the counter asked if we wanted to join a tour. We were like, "Sure." After we had done the sign-up paperwork I couldn't help but comment, "So you haven't mentioned a price yet." It turns out it was free. For a guided tour? This made me suspicious. Also it was an hour long tour that wouldn't involve spending any time in any of the actual facilities. That just raised more questions.

We had to wait around for half an hour, but fortunately there were kittens!

![Image](PXL_20230924_193628521.jpg)

Unfortunately those kittens were very sleepy. I usually think of kittens as being constant balls of energy, but not these ones. They must have been tired from all the playing they did earlier.

We were not the only people on the tour, but in many ways we were. The only other couple had brought their dog along so they had to follow in their own car, listening to the driver's commentary through the radio. So not only was this a free guided tour - it was a free personal guided tour. We could ask all the questions we wanted.

Best Friends Animal Sanctuary is described as a no-kill animal shelter that specialises in animals with behavioural problems or health issues that might have otherwise caused the animal to be put down. During the tour we got told all types of facts. The organisation has about 200 employees and has about 1,600 animals on site. We were shown around facilities for horses, dogs, cats, goats, pigs - even rabbits. And it's not like it was just one room for each animal. There were buildings (plural) for each animal, all with different uses - from a reception for that particular part of the ranch, to facilities for animals with specific contagious diseases. And it was all nestled in the rocky Utah desert.

One section of the ranch we weren't prepared for was a pet cemetery. This was open to the public and anyone could bring their deceased pet to be buried. Seeing the rows and rows of well-tended graves was certainly a humbling site. It's nice to be reminded that so many people love their furry friends, even if they also inevitably have to say goodbye.

Another thing we learned was that the facility does $5 vegan buffet lunches that is also open to the public. We should have come here for lunch rather than Subway for the third day in a row. At the end of the trip the driver announced that we'd be receiving a gift bag to take home. So not only did we not have to pay for this guided tour, we were actually given a small assortment of merch. Naturally we felt obligated to make a donation. However we were never pressured into it. It felt like the organisation is operating for the right reasons and it made us glad we could help in at least a small way.

So that was fun way to spend an afternoon. But we still have more stops to make!

The next was a walk to the Belly of the Dragon. Arriving at the carpark with no cell phone reception, I couldn't remember how long the walk would take. I know I wouldn't have added it to the list for today if it was inappropriately long. In the end we probably spent more time preparing than hiking - the "Belly" was only 40 metres from the carpark. Good thing we got the backpack out.

To undersell it, the Belly of the Dragon was a tunnel underneath a road. I think it was a natural tunnel, carved by a wash which probably flows through in the spring - but I could be wrong. It could just be a man-made drainage tunnel.

Actually now that I think about it - it probably was man-made.

Yep, just looked it up - it's man made. Gah, but I've already written about thinking it was natural. I'm going to look foolish - but what am I going to do about it? Re-write a paragraph?

We followed the trail out the other end of the Belly, until it came to a rockface we couldn't scale. It was time for one last selfie. We now had to say goodbye to the land of red rocks and canyons. It's sad, but we have to at least appear happy.

> We're just happy we got to explore here one more time before we leave

But the day still wasn't over. We stopped at a gas station to top up on Snickers ice cream bars and browse knick-knacks. The attendant suggested we make the return journey via a backroad that just happened to drive past a park.

We'd considered Coral Pink Sand Dunes as a place to go on both this and our 2019 trip. However hiking on sand isn't high on our list of fun things to do. Plus it's a state park so there's an entry fee. So we'd avoided it until now. However as we were driving past we noticed a bit of a hill on the side of the road that looked like it might be an unofficial way into the park

![Image](PXL_20230924_222749946.jpg)

Perhaps we could just take a peek. After all, clearly a lot of other people have.

![Image](PXL_20230924_222918909.jpg)

I don't know about you but does this look coral pink to you? It must be \*something\* orange surely. I'm not disappointed, this is still nice. Okay maybe I am a bit disappointed. How cool would it have been to see pink sand dunes?

Now all that was left to do was drive to Las Vegas. This is where we'd be staying the night. Nothing fancy - just a room in an AirBnB in the suburbs. However it was after sunset when we drove along the highway through the centre of the city. We passed the strip, seeing all the casinos, hotels, and giant billboards lighting up the night. We had seen Las Vegas before and decided the city wasn't a place we needed to explore further. However this little taste of Sin City was a nice treat to end the day.

To wrap this blog post up I have a fun fact:

This has been the 100th blog post that I've written for this trip. 100 adventures worth remembering. It's been a lot of work. I haven't been making it easy on myself. I think I am rambling more and the average photo count has been trending up. However I know I enjoy going back to blogs about previous holidays. It's nice to be able to see these places again, recall memories I had forgotten, and remember what it felt like to be on holiday in these parts of the world.

But 100 isn't the end. There's still more stories to tell about this trip.

And whatever trip comes next.

And whatever trip comes after that.
