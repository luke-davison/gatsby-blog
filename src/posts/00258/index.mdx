Well this is going to be our last blog post from North America. It's going to be a bit of a mixed bag covering eight days worth of stuff. It's also not going to be the most interesting of stuff. Just as this blog post is wrapping up our holiday, we spent this week wrapping up our journey. There's no one last big adventure this time - just a bunch of offloading the gear we no longer need and attempting to cram into our suitcases everything we want to take back.

We spent a night in Portland with Luke (who I will call Other Luke for the purposes of not being too confusing). Here is where our journey unofficially ended. We were still a good 500 kilometres from our final destination but it was here where we mentally snapped out of "holidaying and travelling" mode and back into "duties and obligations" mode. This was a bit annoying because we were going to be travelling through Washington state which had three national parks yet to be explored by us. However, as I said, we weren't thinking "how do we have fun?" any more. We were thinking "oh my god there's so much we have to do"

Let's talk about our car. We had bought it back in April and we now needed to sell it to recoup what we'd paid. We didn't fully understand all the complexities of selling cars in Canada but we understood that it would be easier if we sold in the same province that we bought in - hence why we are travelling back to Vancouver.

We had booked five nights of accommodation in Richmond (which is to Vancouver like Manukau is to Auckland). We hoped that would be enough time to sell our car. It seemed like the right amount of time. However while at Other Luke's we finally started investigating what would be required to sell it. It was then we realised that we might have a problem.

We were hoping to find some sort of car auction place. That way we could get a reliable value for our car and the transaction would be done through an organisation with repute. But there didn't seem to be any in-person places we could take it (other than approaching dealers directly). There were some websites which offered "cash for cars". Some more specialised in scrap cars and wouldn't offer much. However some would do the auction-thing and five days was an appropriate time frame.

Except two of the five days we had were weekends. We really only had three work days to organise the sale. Also when we got estimates from some of those websites, the values were disappointingly low. I felt like I could foresee how this was going to go and we'd only be getting back a quarter of what we paid for it. Maybe not even that.

It was then that Other Luke recommended selling through Facebook Marketplace. He described it as easy. Well, we hadn't wanted to do this due to the hassle and potential issues with selling privately but at this stage we didn't have many options. So the next day we put it up for sale with some pictures I took back in Ontario and we waited.

But we didn't have to wait for long. Within minutes I had a message pop up asking about the car. Then another. Then another. Over the next three days I think about 70 people messaged me about the car. Many were actively interested often asking, "How soon can I see it?" Some asked if we were flexible on price. We were initially, but then we started getting responses for people who made it clear that they would pay our asking price. Very quickly the issue became, "Well who do we pick to sell it to?"

We had put up the listing before we even arrived back into Canada so no one could pressure us into a quick sale. One person ended up standing out. I had originally told him "no" because we already had enough interest but he was insistent. He told us that he was collecting cars of this model in different colours and really wanted ours. He told us about the other cars he'd bought as well as the other models they've done this type of thing with. He was also buying on behalf of a dealership - which sounds like a red flag but it is actually a good thing because it means we're dealing with someone who knows the buy/sell process.

He turned up to have a look at the car the morning after we arrived in Vancouver. He did the usual inspections. Then we took it for a test drive round the block. He tried to haggle us down $300 because he'd noticed the brakes were bad - but we'd already decided we wouldn't budge on the price. We knew we'd already under-priced the car so someone else would be willing to pay our asking price if he backed out. He clearly knew that too but I don't blame him for giving it a shot. We also knew the brakes probably needed new pads.

So he made a phone call to do one final check and that's when we got the bad news. He had bought the car history and apparently there was a lien on the car. We were like, "Uh, we don't know anything about that." To which he replied, "Uh, a car with a lien can't be sold."

Worst case scenario! We're leaving the country in a few days and now we have a car that can't be sold. It's not like this guy could even be trying to scam us to get it cheaper because he's just told us the province won't accept the sale at any amount. But wait, this lien was dated in 2022. Then how could we have purchased it in April 2023?

He called the company with the lien and got no answer. Then I called them. The person I spoke to was just like, "Oh that's not right. Let me issue you out a notice confirming we have no interest in the car". Our buyer then did our own checks and after a couple of hours we were all happy that the sale could go through.

But how were we going to get paid? We didn't bank with any Canadian banks and we really wanted to ensure we got paid before we left the country. We discussed cash, but who wants to have to handle thousands of dollars in cash? Interestingly Canada has a system that allows near instant payments and all you need is the recipients email address. Fortunately Wise (the system we'd been using to transfer NZ dollars across) is part of this scheme and Betty was able to sign up for it. Then we had a weird moment where we had to ask the buyer in advance to test it by paying us money (at this point he hadn't even met us or seen the car yet). But he was happy enough to send a dollar across and it came through within two minutes. Such a neat system and it meant we could get paid straight away without having to risk carrying around thousands in cash.

But the story doesn't stop there. We now had to deregister our plates. We also had to cancel our insurance. Fortunately in Canada these two things are done at the same place. So we had no problem deregistering our car but they wanted to send out a cheque for our insurance overpayment. "Can't you put it back onto our credit card like you did last time," we asked. The answer we got was, "No we can't BECAUSE we already did it that way last time". We had to go back and forth several times to try and work out how we could get our refund. And because we didn't have a car it meant we had to walk half an hour to the nearest office each time. At least the weather was sunny (somewhat rare for Vancouver) so it was nice to be out walking.

In the end, we managed to get everything done with one or two days to spare. So our "five nights" estimate of how much time we needed was perfect. It meant we could relax a bit. We couldn't really go anywhere because we no longer had a car. We still had some other things to plan. Our journey doesn't quite end here.

Before we left Ontario we had an idea about visiting Hawaii. That is still the plan! Tickets direct from Vanvcouver to New Zealand aren't on special so there's no incentive to fly direct. Effectively we get to fly for free to Hawaii because we had to fly over it anyway.

We ended up donating our bedroom and tent to a charity thrift shop. We were happy to pay for additional baggage on a flight back to New Zealand. Except we're not going straight back to New Zealand. And because we're planning to island-hop in Hawaii, we're actually going to be taking four different flights in the next week. We decided it wouldn't be worth paying for additional baggage four times and also having to carry it round for a week. We also weren't likely to use them in New Zealand. We were mostly wanting to bring them back as mementos of our journey. Fortunately if we want to reminisce about our camping adventures, these blogs are always going to be here.

Speaking of which, let's reflect on our journey. Here is a very basic map I made of where we've travelled.

It feels a bit weird to claim that we came here to live in Canada when judging from this map we appeared to spend a lot more time in the States. However that's merely a quirk of geography. USA is big and square while Canada doesn't have much going on north of Calgary.
