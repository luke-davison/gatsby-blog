We woke at Castlepoint to find the weather had improved. The wind was no longer howling and the rain had stopped (potentially just temporarily). Unfortunately a mist lay over the town so we still couldn’t experience the beach and cove at their most beautiful.

So we decided to continue on our way. We basically had to go back through Masterton so of course we went back to that bakery / cafe from yesterday. More yums were had.

Our stop for the day was at the bottom of the island – not near any towns. So you know what that means – more country roads.

> They didn’t always obey the “keep left unless passing” rule

We were heading to a place called the Putangirua Pinnacles. They were a series of rocky, sandy structures created when the earth around them was eroded away. This walk was chosen partially because it was something unique to see, in a part of the country we hadn’t seen. However I’m not going to deny that it was also chosen because it was a location from the Lord of the Rings movies.

In the third movie, three characters have to venture into “the paths of the dead” to find an army of ghostly soldiers. The location is only on screen only briefly – to the point that I couldn’t find any good screenshots to add here as a comparison.

Anyway, there were two paths – one up to the lookout, one up the stream to the pinnacles. Betty thought the lookout sounded better – but the heroes didn’t come to the path of the dead just to look out at them. They were among them. So we hiked up the stream.

> They do look a bit scary, definitely understand why this location was picked

The path kept disappearing and so a lot of the time we were walking up the stream – or rather, where the stream would be if there had been a lot of rain recently. Which I suppose I should mention, it wasn’t exactly fine. The rain kept coming and going, which was getting a bit annoying. Do we wear our jackets, or not?

I think the answer was “not”, but that didn’t stop us trying to wear them. However half way through the walk the sun started coming out which made everything super humid. If only we had just been one hour later and we would have had a nicer walk in the sun.

Anyway, we made it to where we were starting to see some of the pinnacles. I was trying to keep my eye out for possible filming locations, but everything was sloped. These pinnacles were created from flowing water and water flows downhill so it made sense the ground wasn’t flat. But it didn’t look very hilly in the movie. Perhaps it was a bit further on?

> Hmm, maybe not – too scary

Or perhaps up one of the side valley things?

> Nope, just a silly person up here

Eventually I did give up. Hiking up a rocky stream was hard work. So we backtracked and followed the path up to the lookout. Here is the point that everything got humid – right as we were going upward. The view of the pinnacles wasn’t bad – if further away than I was expecting.

The area certainly looked a lot bigger than it did from the ground. Perhaps I should have gone further. Perhaps then I would have found flat ground where I could have re-enacted the scenes. No matter.

And so back to the car we went.

> Betty disappointed we didn’t find the exact filming locations. Or maybe she’s happy that the sun is now shining. It’s hard to tell when she’s facing away but I didn’t get any pics of her smiling face today.

That was enough for today, we decided. Time to drive to Upper Hutt. Our accommodation should be ready by the time we arrive.
