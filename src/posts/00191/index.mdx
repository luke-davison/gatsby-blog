Okay, so where are we?  We plan to spend the next two nights on the east side of Glacier National Park.  So we figured today we ought to finish whatever walks we might want to do on the west of the park.  The west side was basically the main entrance, so we figured there'd be a lot to do.  But with the scenic drive mostly closed, we found that there actually wasn't a lot of walks that excited us.

We decided to go to the main visitor centre where there were park rangers who could provide information.  They recommended we try a walk to a lake called Fish Lake.  While we were there we used the WIFI and looked up the Fish Lake walk.  A big climb to start with but no good views.  No shade the whole way.  And potentially a lot of mosquitos as well.  It seemed very unremarkable.

So we made the conscious decision to ignore the park ranger's advice and instead we drove east.

> Remembering to photograph the sign on the way out

We headed for a part of the park called Two Medicine.  A weird name.  There is a Native American reservation nearby so presumably its something to do with them.  The walk we had picked out was a trail to a place called Scenic Point.  Obviously if a trail is going to have a name like that it ought to be worthwhile.  We knew the walk would involve a fair bit of elevation change, but that's almost to be expected for a mountain viewpoint trail.

The first part of the walk was forested.  There were bear warning signs about and many other hikers were carrying bear spray.  Having no other anti-bear equipment, we did the least that we could, which was to occasionally sing the song that happened to be stuck in our heads that particular day.

> Because bears are afraid of pop music

Very soon the path came out of the forest onto more open terrain.  Probably no chance a bear would live here, unless they like the taste of rocks - because that's about all that was about.

> I know, I know - this isn't a very rocky photo.  There's rockier ones coming, I promise.

The walk itself was a constant incline.  It was a very mixed weather day - plenty of clouds around but the sun could still be quite hot.  But annoyingly the wind seemed to barely ever sent the cloud cover our way.

As we climbed though, we were treated to better and better views of the valley.

We actually had no idea where the track was taking us.  We'd seen the trail on a map earlier, but trails can look quite different on paper compared to in real life, thanks to that pesky third dimension.  But there was no reason to worry about that now.  There was only one path so we just had to keep walking.  And the path kept going up.

And when we got to the top, that wasn't even the end.  The view was scenic but it wasn't really a "point".  Instead we had to walk along to a rocky hill that gave both good views of the park, as well as views of the surrounding countryside.

Then we proceeded to ignore the view of the surrounding countryside and only take photos with the mountains.  This was partly because there were a lot of clouds out to the east, and not much else to look at other than cloud covered grasslands.  Partially cloudy mountains were much more pleasing to look at.

Fun fact: while trying to take this above photo I startled a marmot out of where it had been resting.  It then insisted on having it's own picture taken with the gorgeous view.

Another fun fact: we generally avoid talking to people.  Photos like the one following are generally the result of someone else initiating an exchange of photos being taken.

This walk really made us remember why we like walking in the mountains so much.  It's certainly nice to walk through a forest to a lake.  In fact, a lake walk would be a perfect weekend day trip.  But when we've been out amongst nature for as long as we have now, we need something a bit more... up.

The good news in that regard is that we are planning to spend a fair amount of time in the Canadian Rockies - of which Glacier National Park is basically part.  In fact, Glacier National Park reaches the USA/Canadian border, north of which is the first Canadian National Park that we plan to visit.

And it's now officially summer.  Judging by how dry this walk was (a bit of snow about but none anywhere near the path) there should now be plenty of walkable trails for us when we make our return to USA's northern neighbour.  So hopefully mission accomplished - we should hopefully have avoided most of the colder Spring weather (although I think June is still very Spring-ish).

But anyway, back to this walk.  Near the bottom of the trail we spotted a party of four goats on the other side of the valley.  We watched as they crossed over, then joined our trail going in the same direction.

It felt like we were shepherding them along.  We eventually managed to overtake them and we continue on.  That is, until we got to a junction and we decided to backtrack on a different path to see a waterfall.  And on this path, who did we find?

The goats must have taken a shortcut and now they were heading in the opposite direction.  We decided not to bother trying to find the waterfall (it didn't seem like it was going to be that interesting anyway) and so we reversed direction.  But the goats kept coming.  Now we were the ones being shepherded.  In fact, I would go so far as we were being chased.

We were able to outrun them eventually.

Even though we'd spent quite a bit of time walking today we made one stop to check out a proper waterfall before leaving the park.

> It might not be clear from the picture but there was basically two waterfalls here.  Water was coming out of the rocks, while the stream fell over the top.

So that basically wraps up our trip to Two Medicine.  Which works out quite nicely.  We leave the country in two days.  And there is also two more regions of Glacier National Park for us to visit.  I hadn't specifically planned it this way, but it seems like I couldn't have planned it better.
