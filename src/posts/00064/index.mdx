Okay, here’s a shorter blog post.

The day is Monday 22nd of July. We are saying goodbye to our Canmore accommodation and heading north to Jasper National Park. But before we do, we have one last opportunity to do a hike in Banff.

We picked one called the Boom Lake trail. It was rated as being “easy” despite the length and led to a rather nice lake (apparently). After yesterday’s difficulty getting to Stanley glacier, we had decided that lakes were the place to be.

Here’s the only photo I took of the trail:

Seems pretty nice, doesn’t it?

Well, this was by far the easiest part of the track. While there wasn’t too much elevation gain and the track was fine most of the time, it wasn’t exactly an “easy” track. We’d assumed that “easy” meant that it would be suitable for prams or push-chairs etc. Well, this was certainly not. It was frequently bumpy and occasionally very muddy. Plus, the length made it rather strenuous.

Anyway, here’s our reward for hiking 5km one way:

It was a rather nice lake. Very clear, if not still.

The scenery was very nice. Snow on the mountains certainly made it prettier.

But were we impressed?

Well, kinda.

It was a nice lake but this was another hike where the payoff didn’t quite match the time and effort we’d put into it. Had this been a loop, we might have been happy. Had this been the only hike we’d done, we would have loved it.

But for some reason, despite the lake being as nice as the Grassi Lakes, we were a bit disappointed. I’m not sure I understand it myself but this walk just didn’t have the “wow” factor that others had. The walk was just ordinary walk through trees.

As for the lake, here was our next stop (where we ate lunch):

This lake was a 10 second walk from the carpark rather than a 10 kilometre round trip.

I think the point of this story is that the hikes we pick have been a bit hit and miss sometimes. Any of these hikes would be a great weekend activity but some of them are better than others and because we’re cramming a lot of them into one week, we don’t have the time to give them the praise they deserve.

They are all lovely. Banff is full of amazing scenery that we loved experiencing. Even among all the other National Parks we visited, Banff stood out and was probably my favourite of the bunch. Perhaps it was because we were so happy that what would have been above-average hikes seemed like disappointments.

Anyway, what came next this day didn’t disappoint…
