When we flew from New York to Quebec, we came via Montreal. So we had to get off our plane, go through customs in Montreal and then wait to get on a new plane to Quebec.

It was relatively painless. The problem (wasn’t really a problem) was that we had both been watching movies that we hadn’t finished after the first flight. It didn’t matter for me. I was rewatching an animated dragon film I’ve seen plenty of times but Betty was watching something new.

Annoyingly, On our next flight we didn’t have any media content. This didn’t really matter as the flight was only 40 minutes or so. But it meant Betty couldn’t see the end of her film. That was okay. We had a four and a half hour flight from Montreal to Calgary coming up – plenty of time to watch the remaining hour.

Only, I was worried about why we didn’t have any media content on that flight. I theorised that this might not be because the flight was so short, but instead because the flight was domestic. Would we not get anything on our Calgary flight?

Canada appears to have had an influx of budget airlines. Therefore, Air Canada appears to have been forced to cut their services back in order to compete with them. This was great for us because we got cheaper prices. (Once upon a time people would fly across Canada by going to the USA first to save money). But how are we going to entertain ourselves for four and a half hours on our flight from Montreal?

It gets a bit worse. Our flight was in the early evening. Not too bad except that meant we had spent the day out sightseeing. That meant we had spent the day using our phones without being able to charge them. While waiting for the plane we were both on relatively low battery. There was a charging station nearby so we did charge them a bit but we had to hope their was power outlets on the plane.

There was not. There were also no screens either. We had been warned prior to boarding to download an app which would allow us to watch movies on our own devices. Neither of us bothered because we were both on such low battery anyway.

So what did we do? Honestly, I can’t remember. We played games on our phones until they got boring or the battery died. I drafted a blog post until my laptop battery died. We looked through the photos on my other phone that did have battery. I tried to do cryptic crosswords until my mind gave up. Betty read the in-flight magazine probably six times.

Eventually, with a full one and a half hours of flight time to go, I was getting very bored. So we turned to the one activity we usually avoid doing: talking to the person next to me.

He was from Calgary which was nice. Literally the first thing I asked him was, “Is Calgary worth seeing or should we just go straight to Banff.” He thought about it for a bit before replying, “Just go straight to Banff.”

So we told him about our travels. We told him our remaining schedule and he really couldn’t fault it. In fact, he mentioned Vancouver and possibly Jasper before we even mentioned them. Which was nice. It confirmed that we were heading to the right places.

We told him about some of our struggles with the French. He told us a little anecdote about being in Berlin and deliberately going to a McDonalds just so he didn’t have to try and speak German. We were like, “OMG yes! That’s what we did!”

He told us about how he frequently flies as part of his job. We jealously listened as he mentioned bringing his family along on a bit trip around Europe. It was nice to talk to a Canadian. I’d heard that they are nice people but so far we hadn’t had a conversation with one.

As I said, it was good to hear that we weren’t wasting our time. I don’t remember the number of people that have said, “You’ll love it there” when we mention that we’ll be going to Banff. It kinda builds up the expectation a bit. We had high expectations of both Zion and Yellowstone and those two parks fizzled a bit. I was a bit nervous for Banff. Including Jasper, we would be spending five nights in / near these parks. Was that going to be too much?

Well, we know the answer to that question. It’s already happened for us – I just haven’t blogged about it yet. You’ll find out shortly.
