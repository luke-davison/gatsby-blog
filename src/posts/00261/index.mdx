// Teams call with old boss

// Morning rain

// Drove to Volcano National Park. Traffic

// Stopped at the sign. Apparently there was a geocache there but could not find it.

// View from rim

// Different view from rim. Then walked along to get a better view from rim of the steam. Walked along further while Dad returned to get the car

// Lava Tubes walk. Parked at viewpoint for a different crater. Saw that there was a trail going through the crater and really wanted to do it. But Lava Tubes first. Not like Rangitoto ones. A lot more dirt.

// Walked down to crater. Was cloudy when down there, but sun came out before we got all the way across. Surface was really interesting. Didn't feel too much like a crater because walls were forested.

// Drove to Hilo for a late lunch at Cafe 100, creator of the Loco Moco. It started raining on the drive and was heavily raining when we arrived. Learned that Hilo is actually a very rainy town - unlike Kona.

// More traffic.

// Pahoa seems a bit dodgy
