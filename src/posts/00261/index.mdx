Today we're packing up and leaving. We're departing Waikiki, Honolulu, and Oahu altogether and flying to... Hawaii! As well as being the name of the state, Hawaii is also the name of the biggest island in the state. However it seems like everyone just calls it Big Island.

We flew into Kona International Airport on the island's west coast. However we were actually staying on the island's east coast. So why did we fly into Kona rather than Hilo which is the biggest city on the island? Well, its because we booked these flights in a hurry and I didn't pay attention to what was where. However it should be fine, right? We can just travel from one side of the island to the other, right? It's not like this island's name is literally "big".

Back in September, when we decided to leave North America, booking our flights off the continent was one of the first things we did. The reason is that we wanted to do some border crossings and if questioned we wanted to ensure we could show that our plan was to leave USA. Since our Canadian licenses got lost in the mail we knew we wouldn't be able to hire a car in Hawaii so we only planned to spend three nights in Waikiki.

Then we had an idea. What if we had a driver?

You can see where this is going.

So we invited Dad to join us. It's a win / win situation. He gets a holiday and we get to visit some of the places we wouldn't have been able to visit without a rental car. We didn't make him drive back on Oahu because it was too busy and we thought that would be a bit mean. However Big Island is more off the beaten track. Here there'll be a lot more open road driving. That is, as long as he can get used to driving on the right side of the road.

We hired a compact SUV to ensure we'd have enough room for all our bags. Well when we got the car it was definitely an SUV - but I don't know about "compact". Poor Dad, not only is he potentially jetlagged and driving on the wrong side of the road with strange signs and speed limits, he also has to do it in a vehicle that could more easily hit something.

But our adventure continues.

Even before we touched down we noticed that Big Island was different to where we'd come from. Oahu was lush. Where there was not buildings and roads there was forest and grass. Well surrounding Kona airport there was... nothing, really. Just rocks and desert. This is certainly going to be a change from the resorts and beaches of Waikiki.

We had lunch watching a local baseball team practice, sharing a giant supermarket sandwich. We didn't even finish it. Then we set off to cross the island, which meant driving into the mass of cloudy weather hiding the island mountain peak.

The road bisected the island but we took a detour halfway along to drive up the mountain of Mauna Kea. An interesting fact about Mauna Kea is that it is the tallest mountain in the world. Fun fact - it is roughly twice as tall as Everest. Of course, the top of Everest is considerably higher above sea level but Everest's problem is that it also start high above sea level.

I sound like I'm making a joke but Mauna Kea is still incredibly high - a good half a kilometre taller than Mount Cook. There's signs on the way up advising travellers not to drive up too fast in case of altitude sickness. We're actually required to stop at the visitor centre halfway up. So we did.

And unfortunately to drive any further we need a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Not because the road is bad, but because it's so steep that two-wheel-drive brakes just aren't good enough. So that puts an end to our plans to summit the mountain. But we're still 2,700 meters above where we started our drive.

So let's go for a walk.

Poor Dad. Not only does he have to drive, we bring him to the land of heat and humidity and make him climb mountains.

Now Mauna Kea has more than just volcanic rocks and geocaches - there is also an observatory up here. Something interesting about Mauna Kea is that it has an unbelievably high number of clear night skies each year. This is quite amazing as from here we're heading to the city of Hilo - which is apparently known for having an unbelievably high number of rainy days each year.

Anyway, there was a lot of space-related stuff at this visitor centre - including ice cream!

After we drove back down to the main road I spotted another trail on Google Maps.

// Packed up early and caught an Uber to the airport

// Short flight

// Landscape of Big Island is really different. Very volcanic.

// Picked up car. It's huge. Dad has to drive.

// Bought a big sub to share with Dad for lunch, and then again for dinner

// Drove to Mauna Kea. The tallest mountain the world? Couldn't drive all the way up because the road is too steep for 2WD. Went for a walk. Dad found a geocache.

// Stopped on the highway to do another walk. Another geocache found.

// Walmart at Hilo. Nothing special happened here

// Hostel at Pahoa. Very rustic - shared toilets and showers, most of which are outside. No AC - windows open. Lots of insect / jungle noises
