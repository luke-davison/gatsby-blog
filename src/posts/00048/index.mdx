While the morning was taken up by flying and recovering from flying, we still needed an afternoon activity.

Behind Ben Lomond is a valley with a lake that supposedly was nice to walk around. Despite being so close to Queenstown (as close as “on the other side of a mountain” can be) the valley certainly felt very isolated. Gravel road, no cellphone coverage, basically no residential houses in sight. On one side of the lake was a campsite. With the sun shining overhead it seemed like a great place to relax and unwind.

The lake is Moke lake, for those of you who like knowing the names of things. Here is photographic evidence that we were here:

> Exhibit A: one hat wearing male next to one lake

While researching this walk we came across a blog entry about a “secret lookout” that could be reached. Lake walking is rather nice but in the end you’re just looking at the same thing from 360 only slightly different angles. So we decided to tack this lookout walk to the start of the loop around the lake.

> Exhibit B: one hat wearing female following one fence line

First we had to follow a fence line for several hundred metres. Then it took a sharp left up a hill. Turns out it’s not so much a track to a viewpoint than it is a hill that people have previously clambered up. And it wasn’t exactly a small hill.

> Not really a path – just a line where grass had been trampled out of existence

It was about half way up that we realised that we might have made a mistake. We’d come here for a nice walk around a lake and now we’re stumbling up the side of a hill on half a path, in the mid afternoon sun. Our legs weren’t terrible, but the certainly remembered the hike from yesterday. Bees and another insects surrounded us for a good portion on the climb – always threatening to sting, though fortunately never doing so. And for some reason the cows wouldn’t stop moo-ing. There was only a small paddock of them on the opposite side of the valley, but they just wouldn’t shut up.

Three quarters of the way up, we stared out at the lake and the rest of the valley and pondered the question, “Is reaching the top going to give us any better a view?” Well, we’re not quitters so we stuck it out. And you know what we found…

> Fun fact – this lake is in the shape of a pair of pants

…a view not all that different from what we could see three quarters of the way up.

Well, at least at the top we could sit on the other side of the peak which muffled the sound of the cows. But the view – as satisfying and pleasing as it looked – was hard to enjoy. It was a tough climb but it was a tough climb that we didn’t need to do.

Well, at least we’ve worked out our buns and thighs.
