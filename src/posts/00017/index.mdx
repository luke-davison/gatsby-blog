Today we’re off into the Kaweka Forest Park – a somewhat mountainous region inland from Napier. While the altitude isn’t too high, some of it gets up into “alpine” territory and the plan for today is to get up there.

First stop was to pick up some lunch – a Subway sandwich. We’re hiking – we can afford to treat ourselves a little, even if the sandwich is a bit smooshed by the time we eat it. Last time we bought one of these, I put it on the backseat on top of some other things. It must have leaked or something because now my hoodie and Betty’s laptop bag both have that Subway smell. I’m actually quite thrilled to have that aroma – Betty less so.

The place we were walking from was a 70 minute drive. It took a bit longer for several reasons. One, there was a whole bunch of these on the road at one point.

> Very nice, with the matching earings

However it also took a bit longer because the road had so many corners. I guess I drive round them a bit slower than Google Maps thinks I should. Also, then the road turned to gravel. And then we arrived at what we thought was our destination, only to find we had 7 more kilometres of gravel road driving to go. And it was not fun. Much less maintained than the Te Urewera road, we were frequently rocking back and forward.

I tell you what, once this trip is over I am going to be done with gravel roads. If you’re ever inviting me over, I’ll be asking, “Are all the roads sealed? Oh you live in the CBD? Well I’d still like you to check – not risking it.”

So we get to the carpark at the end. We’re already quite high up – the trees are smaller and gnarlier. The path we’ve chosen goes even higher – right up to the highest point in the Hawke’s Bay. So we start climbing.

There wasn’t much to the track – it just went up. Within 15 minutes we had lost all tree cover and the landscape was just rocks and small bushes.

The weather forecast for today was predicting “cloudy”. And as you can see, it certainly delivered.

Perhaps too cloudy. As we neared the top we noticed that one of the peaks wasn’t visible anymore.

Fortunately we weren’t going to that peak. Unfortunately we were going to a peak higher than that one.

As we got higher, the track got rockier until the track was all rocks. Sometimes this made it tricky as one step up would be half a step of rocks sliding down.

As we approached the top, we noticed something. The only sound was the wind rushing by our ears. There were no birds, no insects, no running water, no trees moving in the wind, no cars in the distance, and no talking (too tired to talk). So when the wind dropped it was eerily quiet.

As we came over the top, something strange happened. We walked out into blue skies. I mean sure, there are clouds but we could see so far. Ruapehu and Ngarahoe were clearly visible in the distance, the former still covered in snow.

For context, the following photo was taken at the same time, after I did a 180 degree turn.

It was as if the mountain range was a barrier keeping the two different weathers apart. The photo below looks along the ridge at the top. The white nothingness on the right hides where views of the Hawke’s Bay should be.

It was also quite cold. We’d both donned our jackets. Makes sense though, it was 300 metres higher than that Rock Peak walk we did a few days ago, and we don’t have the sun to warm us. I did find some small patches of snowy ice that were resisting melting.

So we ate our sandwich, staring off towards the Central Plateau, watching it slowly fade to white as the clouds came over the ridge from behind us. It was certainly peaceful. We never did see a single person.

> So lonely

But perhaps this wasn’t the hike for us. Too much mountaineering. Too much hiking up and down loose rock paths. Too much gravel road driving. Perhaps it’s just the rocks – do I just not like rocks?

> Back down in the land of grass and trees

There was nothing else done this day. Maybe we needed more of a rest. I had another hike planned for tomorrow – one that might be longer than today’s. But as the weather looks like it might worsen again tomorrow – I think we’re just going to skip it.

We’ll find something else to do tomorrow.
