There’s no getting around it – Yosemite is quite busy at this time of the year. The parking lots are bursting. There are traffic jams on the valley roads. On more than one occasion we couldn’t get on a shuttle bus because it was already full. One of the bus rides I had wanted to do is already full for tomorrow – and for several more days.

I overheard someone mention that visitor numbers in the National parks exploded in the last 10 years. I’d heard this before. We’re already planning to skip one of the trails we were planning to do in Zion because it gets so populated. Apparently there was no issue with overcrowding in the early 2000s. Around that time broadband internet use rose, digital cameras started to exist, and image heavy travel blogs became a thing. And that meant everyone now knew exactly what they were missing out on by staying at home. I’d look up the exact factors, but I currently don’t have an internet connection. I’m having to type this up in some version of notepad on my suddenly less useful laptop. I’ll post it later. Or possibly never. Not sure yet.
