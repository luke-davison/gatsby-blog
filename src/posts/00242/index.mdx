Over the last six days we have travelled roughly 3,500 kilometres. A lot of things could have gone wrong when travelling such a distance. So we built had a day of "wiggle room" into our itinerary- just in case. And when we realised that this part of Utah was on our route, why not have our "wiggle room" day in the place we enjoyed the most in our spring/summer travels? In fact, why not add a second "wiggle room" day to our itinerary? You know, just in case things go really pear-shaped.

Well things did not go pear-shaped. They remained normal-shaped. What shape is that? Circle-shaped? Apple-shaped? Anyway, that's not important. What's important is that we now have up to three days in this area to do as we want. And as it happens, there were also three park areas that we couldn't visit back in May due to weather-related issues. We managed to fit Cedar Breaks in yesterday afternoon. Next on the list is a hike (of sorts) called The Narrows, found in Zion National Park.

However there's a few steps we have to take to get there.

Step 1: Get up early.

This was surprisingly easy, probably because we were in bed earlier than usual - likely thanks to yesterday's hike as well as the changing timezones.

Step 2: Pick up lunch

This walk was going to be an all-day affair so we needed to pick up our lunch before entering the park. So we made a quick stop to Subway.

Step 3: Drive to Springdale

This wasn't the hardest step - the town was a little more than an hour away.

Step 4: Pay for parking

The town of Springdale enjoys being on the doorsteps of Zion National Park and so you don't get anything for free here. Parking is expensive here, unless you park at the end of the city nearest the city, then its even more expensive. I think it cost us about $50 NZD for a day of parking. But we really wanted to do this walk so we decided not to think too much about it and just paid the machine.

Step 5: Catch the bus to the park entrance

Fortunately the premium parking spot meant we could just walk there instead

Step 6: Queue to catch the bus into the park

Naturally this involved a lot of standing around.

Step 7: Catch the park bus to the end of the line

Naturally this involved a lot of sitting around. Even though we had got up early it was now nearly noon by the time we exited the bus. And this isn't even the last step.

Step 8: Hike to get to the start of the hike

There was a mile-long trail to get to the start of The Narrows hike.

While it takes a bit of effort to get into Zion National Park, upon entering it immediately feels worth it.

Even if you just caught the bus in and out, you'd get to see quite a lot of stunningly-coloured rock. Speaking of the bus - it contains information as well as warnings not to feed the squirrels human food because it makes them fat. Well, as we walked along we found some of those squirrels:

Anyway, we're here to hike so let's get to it. Here is the start to the Narrows walk:

The trail goes through a slot canyon - which is a thin, deep canyon carved by running water. Unfortunately the stream still flows through this canyon and often the canyon is just the same width as the canyon. There's no trail here. For much of the hike we'll be walking in the stream.

Fortunately there were some parts of the canyon which were not underwater. Usually everyone would cross from side to side to minimise the amount of time getting wet. However this lasted only so long. After three crossings, one after another, we came to a particularly thin part of the canyon. While before the water was only thigh-high - this went a lot deeper.

We carried our backpacks above our heads to ensure they were kept out of the water. In order to get into the park I had needed to show ID so mine was carrying my passport (though in a zip-lock bag). Also we had a footlong sub - we definitely don't want that to get soaked.

Here is Betty indicating how high the water came up to:

> As you can see the water was about 0.6 Bettys deep

It should have been obvious but hiking through water is a lot different to hiking through not-water. Our feet were always going to be getting soaked - there was no way around that. Sure, you could hire some rubber boots but unless they reached our chest they were not going to keep our feet dry. I think they were more to help keep our feet warm. Even this late in the season the water is still originally from snow-melt, and this deep in the canyon it doesn't get warmed by the sun much - so it can be quite cold. Fortunately neither of us had an issue with the water temperature.

Another issue was trying to walk without falling over. The stream bed is full of rocks - none of which are flat. The water also isn't very transparent so we couldn't see what we were stepping on or how solid our footing was. Many people had hired sticks to help them balance themselves as they walked through water. Well, Betty and I had a better idea:

![Image](PXL_20230922_182533226.jpg)

We were each others' sticks. It worked exceptionally well. I don't know why more people weren't doing this. I guess there's a risk that if we both wobbled in the same direction a the same time then we might both end up in the water but that didn't happen. We could also move quite fast because we weren't needing to ensure our sticks were secure before leaning on them.

// The red walls are so beautiful

// Maybe a good thing we didn't start early because the sun is now mostly overhead

// Lots of people with poles and hired shortest

// Fat squirrels

// Crossed the river three times - fourth time was very deep. Had to hold our bags out of the water - after all my passport was in my bag since we needed that to gain entry

// Held hands to cross the water. Often couldn't see what we were walking on and the river bed was very uneven. Holding hands seemed easier than the poles.

// Lots of people

// Very high walls

// Can go as far as you want. We made it to the junction, then went a bit down each path before turning back

// A lot less careful on the way back. Just walked fast down the river, not caring to stay to the busy shallows

// Didn't fall over

// Getting back out of the park took a while. Some long queues for the buses, which also took a while

// Drove to Kanab. Frozen meals for dinner
