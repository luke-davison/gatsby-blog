// Early start - 7-Eleven breakfast and lunch. Dad had the leftover Snickers icecream

// First stop was an impromptu stop while driving through Volcano National Park, because I saw there was a virtual cache. Unfortunately it did require a walk in the sun. The end result were some footprints and some info about some fighting which was interrupted by a volcanic eruption. Kind of interesting, but not as cool and with much more effort than the Devil's Throat yesterday.

// Next stop was a random viewpoint that was on Google Maps. Lucky for us it was right by a geocache. It was the small magnet case again.

// We then went to the Kahuku Unit (check spelling) of Volcano National Park. There we did a walk which crossed a few different terrains, but nothing we hadn't seen before. Perhaps it would have been better if we had the guidebook so we could read out the tidbits of info at the 11 stops along the trail.

// Then we drove to South Point. This was quite a nice spot, black rock cliffs over beautiful water. It was really hot, but the wind was blowing. We had to help push another car that had got stuck halfway off the road.

// At South Point there was a diving platform of sorts. However, there was also a sign advising people not to dive, as well as a lot of fishing rods nearby. So I decided not to jump into that inviting water.

// We didn't want to have lunch at South Point because it was too hot so we drove up to Ocean View to buy some cold drinks and eat at a nearby park (the normal ones with a playground, basketball court, and baseball field)

// Drove on to Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park. We thought we'd get in free with the National Parks Pass, but it was free anyway. Saw some things but overall not that interesting.

// Couldn't go to the other National Historical Park because it was already closing (4pm) and Captain Cook monument was going to be too much walking. On the way to accommodation Dad reminded me that there was a camera geocache that he wanted to get in Kona. So we went downtown and found there to be a market.

// Got the geocache and walked through the market. No interest in buying anything, although some soap bubbles did amuse us for a while

// Sunset

// Overall it wasn't a super satisfying day. We did a few things but nothing was that great. South Point was scenic though. However we were never going to know unless we tried
