As mentioned in the previous blog post, we were up surprisingly early today.  This was partly because people were up even earlier, and partly because the sun was up even earlier than them.  I guess we're getting more northerly now so the days are going to be longer.  Not going to lie, another deciding factor was likely the lack of WIFI.

Badlands National Park wasn't quite what I was expecting.  For such a scary name (doesn't get much badder than "bad") there was a surprising amount of grass in the park.  In fact, the scenery appeared to be just grass and white rock ridges and structures.  Ordinarily white rock would be not that great to look at, but because it was sprinkled among lush green it was strangely pleasing to look at.

We decided to try a couple of small walks this morning.  The first was called the Notch trail, which went up a small canyon.

I had read that early or late in the day were the best times to visit the park.  This is because the shadows make the rock structures more defined.  I guess the midday sun would just bleach them all in light and make them less interesting.

The "notch" ended up being a bit of an elevated gap in the rocks with views over the surrounding countryside.

But the walk really hadn't taken very long at all.  Was this all there was to it?  After all, supposedly this was the most popular walk in the park.

So we tried following the rest of the canyon in case the path was actually supposed to continue on.  But we found no more markers, and it wasn't all that long until we came to another notch.

I guess that was it then.

There were two other short walks that started from the same parking lot, so we figured we'd walk those too while we were here.  The Window Trail was barely a trail, at about 300 metres in length.  It also was severely lacking in windows.

The other trail was at the distant end of the parking lot.  As we walked to it, we noticed a lot of flying creatures around a shelter.  They looked a lot like bats, but surely this was too late in the day for them to be so active.  As we got closer we found that they were barn swallows, and that they'd been building a lot of nests along the roofline.  They had basically taken over this structure with nests on all four sides, both inside and out.

The other trail was called the Door Trail, and like the Window Trail we have no idea why it got that name.  Fortunately it was much longer and more interesting than the Window Trail.

It led to a rocky area with lots of little canyons about.

Three walks done, but we decided we wanted some more.  We found a walk up to a saddle and figured we'd try that.  This was a very steep walk, but surprisingly popular.  The carpark was small and basically full when we got there.  Although this just made me question, why were two carparks devoted to being handicap spaces for a parking lot where the only activity is a steep walk?

It didn't take long to get to the saddle.

But on the other side of the saddle wasn't much of a view - it was just more fields.  Since there wasn't really anywhere to walk to, we just made our way back down.

Which was a tiny bit scrambly, but we got there.

Having now done all the walks we wanted to do here, we decided we'd just drive the scenic road through the park and then head on.  Of course we would stop whenever we saw something interesting.

At one stop there was a bunch of fossil info, but it was another structure that had been overrun by barn swallows that got more of our attention.

Some of the stops had view points:

Actually most of the stops had view points:

Although one of the stops had view points of a field.  That wasn't a very exciting stop.  I think we got back in the car within the minute when we realised it was a 400 metre walk to see grass.

We departed Badlands National Park having enjoyed our time here.  It's not one of the great National Parks.  But it's pretty good (and especially unique) for this part of the country.  We'll probably never want to come back here, but that mostly is because if we do return to the USA we'll probably want to be elsewhere.

But this wasn't the end of the day for us.  It was barely midday.  There was still a lot of driving to do, but also there was another attraction I wanted to visit before we continued north.  But I'm going to talk about that in the next blog post.
