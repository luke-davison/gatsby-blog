We arose quite late this morning.  With all the trees around in the campgrounds we often aren't woken by the early sun (or rather, we just go back to sleep).  What usually wakes us is the noise of people (and sometimes birds).  But at this campground there weren't that many other campers and I guess those that did leave, left very quietly.  By the time we got up, ate, and packed up our gear it was actually after the time we're supposed to have checked out by.  But that was fine, after all there was no one around to notice.

I mentioned yesterday that there was one walk that we had planned to attempt but didn't get round to doing.  Well, we decided that today we'd drive back and do it.  This area is technically within driving distance of our next camping site, but we figured we ought to finish the trails that would be furthermost away.

This one was called Parker Ridge.  We'd spotted it on the drive through yesterday and it didn't look that impressive - but the reviews were favourable so up we go!

> "Always up walking.  Never flat walking."

Most of the trail was just zig-zagging up the side of the hill.  This did give us a nice view of the valley - but it wasn't the best view.  It was quite close to the Athabasca Glacier from yesterday, but annoyingly it was just around a corner - so no excellent icy views.

> I think the viewpoint we were at yesterday might be the close hill on the right side of the photo

Before too long we reached the top of the ridge.  Lots of people were just sitting round here.  Success?  No - it looks like the trails continues on.

"Parker ridge" doesn't sound too exciting.  A peak is where you get the best views.  But a ridge is actually a pretty good walk too - because when you get to the top you are greeted with a view of the other side of the ridge as your reward.

To our surprise, there was another glacier on the other side of the ridge - as well as another turquoise pool that used to be the glacier.  Shape-wise, it looked a lot like the Athabasca Glacier.  Given their proximity, the two must be related.

After topping the ridge, the walk ran along the other side for a while before it just stopped...

> "This is it?"

I was expecting that it was leading us to a viewpoint over the valley where our campground had been.  But nope, it just stopped.  It made me wonder whether this was even part of the official trail - maybe the hike was supposed to end back at the top of the ridge.  However the "End of trail" sign was pretty definitive.

> Regardless of the abruptness, it was a nice place to stop

This was certainly a nice angle of the glacier.  Naturally we hung out here for a while, enjoying the mountain scenery.

But we did have to go back at some point...

The next stop was back in Banff National Park.  This one was called Peyto Lake and the size of the parking lot showed that it certainly was popular.  I had forgotten what was here exactly.  It looked like there was a short walk to the lake, and then a longer walk up to a viewpoint.  Since we'd just done a strenuous walk I figured we could just walk to the lake, have a rest, then continue on after we'd recovered a bit.

Well, that short walk ended up being a very steep walk.  Then when we arrived, we found that we weren't at a lake at all - instead we were at a lake viewpoint.  And like the waterfall ones yesterday, people inevitably end up crowding such a viewpoint.

> How did that really steep walk not scare everyone off?

The lake certainly was vibrant today.  But we didn't want to stick around with so many people around - so we did our best to get some photos without too many random strangers and we continued on.

Naturally the crowd thinned out afterwards.  And perhaps for good reason.

> Up again...

Most of the walk was basically a four wheel drive track.  They're not the most fun to walk on - often being quite rocky and occasionally being quite steep.  At least we were getting some views though.

![Image](PXL_20230705_214604750.jpg)

Like the Parker Ridge trail, this one just kind of stopped.  Or did it?  The trail changed from wide four wheel drive sized trail to a smaller trail that was clearly the result of hundreds of hikers stamping their feet.  Did we overshoot the end point?  Soon after we came to a hill with several cairns.

![Image](PXL_20230705_220207425.jpg)

It wasn't a great place to stop.  It really just seemed like everyone walking this trail had done the same thing that we ended up doing - continued on past the wide trail and then eventually given up and decided that this could act as the turn around point.  The cairns were a nice touch at making it seem official.

Overall we weren't really feeling this trail.  It was certainly not as scenic or nice to walk on as the last two that we've done.  In fact, that really was the main reason we didn't enjoy it as much - we were a bit tired out from the last two trails.

So we walked down and departed for the Banff township - still another hour to drive before we could have a proper meal.  Then we hit traffic again.

This was the same traffic jam that we hit trying to get Lake Louise last month - but this time going the other way.  Learning from my mistake last time, I switched to the outermost lane because it would end up going faster.  Except this time it was the slower lane.  Just my luck.

This wasn't even the only traffic jam we'd hit today.  There had been another along the parkway.  Some construction was being done on a bridge and the stop/go lights that they had were switching far too frequently.  Not only did it not let enough cars through at a time (leading to a long queue) it also didn't leave long enough for cars to drive all the way through.  Fortunately we were early enough that we escaped the worst of it.

> Here was where that queue was

As we arrived at Banff we hit another queue, of people trying to get into the township.  It was now 6pm and I guess everyone was doing what we were doing - they were done for the day and it was time to eat.  So we parked as soon as we could and walked into town.

And boy was there a lot of people.

We didn't observe this last time we were in Banff.  When we remembered back to 2019 we realised that we'd only ever gone into the township once, and it was cold and rainy that day.  I guess this is what Banff looks like on normal days.

We decided not to try anything fancy.  We headed to McDonalds where they were handling the ridiculous number of people surprisingly well.  We ate, used the free WIFI a bit, and then left - vowing never to come back to Banff again (at this time of the day anyway).

Although we did grab a beaver tail snack as a reward for all the hiking we'd done.

![Image](PXL_20230706_013301208.jpg)

From what I can tell it's basically just deep fried dough, shaped into a rectangle that \*might\* resemble a beaver tail, then topped with various forms of sugar and butter.  Naturally it was delicious.  Betty told me that we'd had them before - last time we were in Canmore but I don't remember.  I guess I didn't blog about it and the memory faded.  Well this time I'm making a point to document it.

And with that tasty snack our two day adventure along the Icefields Parkway comes to a close.  In part one I had commented that I had deemed the road to be perhaps the most scenic drive I've ever undertaken - but that was only based on one experience.  Given the unpredictably cold weather we've seen there was no guarantee this experience was going to be as enjoyable.  But, as you now know, it was.  And because we gave ourselves extra time, it was even more enjoyable this time around.
